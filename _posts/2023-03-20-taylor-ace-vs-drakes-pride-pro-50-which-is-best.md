<p>I'll be looking at various factors, such as the specs, bias, grip options, price, and who each bowl would be best suited for. By the time you finish reading, you'll have a much clearer idea of which bowl will work best for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>

<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. Its versatility allows it to be used on various surfaces and conditions. The bowl is only available for the UK market and comes in sizes 00 to 5. It can also be found on online second hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Drakes Pride PRO-50 and the Taylor Ace are mid-biased lawn bowls, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2814} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Ace is positioned between the Blaze and the International in the Taylor range, while the PRO-50 is positioned between the D-TEC and the XP in the Drakes Pride range. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Ace is favoured by many indoor bowlers due to its versatility, while the PRO-50 has a similar bias to the popular Professional bowl but with a deeper grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to bias, it ultimately depends on personal preference and playing style. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2796} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, both the Ace and the PRO-50 are popular options for their mid-bias, making them versatile for a range of conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Ace and Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowls offer different types of grip options. The Taylor Ace has a choice between the Progrip and Xtreme grip, catering to different preferences. The Progrip is a dimple grip that provides a classic style of grip with small divots along the shoulder of the bowl. On the other hand, the Xtreme grip is an embedded grip that sits deeper into the bowl, providing a more secure grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 only offers an embedded grip option. This type of grip is suitable for bowlers who have difficulty gripping the bowl properly as it makes the bowl feel smaller in their hand. While it may not offer the classic style of grip that the dimple grip provides, the embedded grip can still provide a secure hold on the bowl. Ultimately, the choice between the two grips will depend on personal preference and what feels most comfortable for an individual bowler.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the price of the Taylor Ace and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowls, there are a few things to consider. The Taylor Ace is generally more expensive, with a new set costing around £360. However, it is worth noting that second-hand options are available for a lower price, with a range of £160-£230. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 is slightly more affordable, with a new set costing around £300. A second-hand set can be found for around £190-£260.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, there is not a significant price difference between these two popular models of lawn bowls. However, those on a tight budget may want to consider looking for second-hand options, as they can provide significant savings. Ultimately, the decision between the Taylor Ace and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 may come down to personal preference and other factors, such as weight and size. Regardless of which model you choose, investing in high-quality lawn bowls is essential for a great game.</p>
