<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2726} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased lawn bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It is an ideal option for bowlers who play on a range of surfaces. Available in sizes 00 to 5, this bowl is designed specifically for the UK market. The Henselite Tiger Pro is a premium product and is considered one of the most expensive lawn bowls on the market. While it might not be readily available in the second-hand market, buying it new is always an option for those looking for top-quality equipment.</p>

<p>The Aero Quantum is a narrow bias lawn bowl designed for fast outdoor and indoor play. It's best suited for indoor bowlers or lead players on fast outdoor greens. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, it's difficult to find second-hand and often needs to be purchased new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro and the Aero Quantum lawn bowls have different biases, which affects how they perform on the green. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2798} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro has a mid-bias and is suitable for all types of bowlers and all kinds of greens, while the Aero Quantum has a narrow bias and is best for indoor and outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowlers who play all year round, both indoors and outdoors, may prefer the Henselite Tiger Pro as it offers versatility on different types of greens. On the other hand, the Aero Quantum is perfect for narrow shots, making it ideal for indoor bowlers who play on tighter boundaries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2826} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the difference in biases between the two lawn bowls means they are suited to different types of bowlers and greens. Bowlers should consider their playing style and the conditions they play in when selecting a bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Aero Quantum lawn bowls, it's clear that grip options are a key difference between the two. The Henselite Tiger Pro has the Heneslite Mega grip as its standard embedded grip, which is ideal for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. On the other hand, Aero offers a range of grip options including a dimple grip, embedded grip, and non-gripped option. All the grips come standard and are available across their entire range, including the Aero GrooVe and Aero Sonic models.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Mega grip is noticeable for its deeper embedded design which can make the bowl feel smaller in the hand. This is an advantage for bowlers who need extra help with grip. Conversely, the dimple grip offered by Aero is a classic style of grip that includes small divots along the shoulder of the bowl. These dimples allow for fingers to be placed comfortably and effectively, which in turn provides better grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's clear that both brands have put thought into designing grips to cater for bowlers with different requirements. Whether it's embedded or dimple, it's worthwhile for bowlers to trial different grips to determine which is best for their individual needs when it comes to selecting a lawn bowl model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Aero Quantum are priced similarly, with both costing around £400 brand new. However, if you are looking to purchase a second-hand set, you can expect to pay slightly less for the Henselite Tiger Pro, with prices ranging from £250-£300. On the other hand, second-hand Aero Quantum sets can cost between £300-£360.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's worth noting that the prices for both models may vary depending on factors such as the condition of the bowls and the seller's location. Ultimately, when it comes to price, there is no clear winner between these two popular models of lawn bowls. It may come down to personal preference and other factors such as grip and weight.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro and Aero Quantum are popular models of lawn bowls with their unique features. If you are a player who enjoys both indoor and outdoor games, the Henselite Tiger Pro is your perfect fit. Since it is a dual-purpose bowl, it can be used in both conditions, and with its flexibility, you can use it in multiple positions in a team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, if you are searching for a narrow biased bowl that performs well both indoors and outdoors, the Aero Quantum is an excellent option. This dual-purpose bowl is recommended for lead bowlers when used outdoors and suits many positions in a team when played indoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, choosing the right model for you is essential to enhance your performance and enjoy the game. Consider the conditions you will be playing in and your role in the team when selecting between the Henselite Tiger Pro and Aero Quantum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Aero Quantum and Henselite Tiger Pro are top-quality lawn bowls, but they are designed for different playing styles and preferences. The Aero Quantum is more suitable for indoor play and fast outdoor greens with a narrow bias, whereas the Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased bowl that gives greater versatility on varied surfaces for both indoor and outdoor play. While both models are hard to find on the second-hand market and come in similar sizes, the Henselite Tiger Pro is notably more expensive. Ultimately, determining which model is right for you depends on your personal preferences and playing style.</p>
