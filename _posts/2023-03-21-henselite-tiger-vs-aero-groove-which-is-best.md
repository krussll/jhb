<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2719} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide-biased bowl designed for outdoor play, with a bias that makes it ideal for use on all types of outdoor surfaces. It is particularly well suited to skips, allowing for precision delivery and control. Available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market, these bowls are not commonly found on online second-hand marketplaces, so purchasing them new may be necessary.</p>

<p>The Aero GrooVe is a mid-biased lawn bowl that is perfect for both indoor and outdoor play. It is a versatile bowl that can be used on a range of surfaces and conditions. Available in sizes 00 to 5, this bowl is only for the UK market and is not easily found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay. It is recommended to buy them new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger lawn bowl is a wide biased bowl that is ideal for outdoor greens and suitable for all outdoor surfaces, but should be avoided for indoor gameplay. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Aero GrooVe lawn bowl is a mid-biased bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor gameplay, making it a versatile option for bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Tiger offers a wider bias, the GrooVe falls in the middle between the Quantum and the Sonic bowls in terms of bias. Both bowls offer unique advantages and disadvantages depending on the game and conditions. </p>

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2822} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the individual's playing style and preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger comes with the Heneslite Mega grip as standard, which is an embedded grip that sits deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand. This is beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl. On the other hand, Aero offers a range of grips on their lawn bowls, including the Aero GrooVe, which comes with a dimple, embedded or non-gripped option at no extra cost. The dimple grip is a traditional style of grip where small divots run along the shoulder of the bowl. It allows your fingertips to sit in these dimples, giving you a firmer grip on the bowl. Overall, both models have fantastic grip options to suit the preferences of a wide range of bowlers.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, both the Henselite Tiger and Aero GrooVe lawn bowls are similarly priced at around £400 for a brand new set. However, if you're looking to purchase second-hand bowls, the Henselite Tiger II ranges from £200-£690, while the Aero GrooVe can be found for around £300-£360 if you're lucky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both lawn bowls are priced similarly and offer high-quality performance for experienced bowlers. For those on a tight budget, looking for second-hand options can provide some savings, but it's important to ensure that you're getting a set that's still in good condition to ensure optimal performance. Ultimately, the choice between the Henselite Tiger and Aero GrooVe will come down to personal preference and specific needs, such as size, weight and grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Henselite Tiger and Aero GrooVe lawn bowls are aimed at different types of players. The Henselite Tiger is best suited for those who play solely outdoors, while the Aero GrooVe is ideal for anyone who wants to play both indoors and outdoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide biased bowl designed specifically for outdoor play. It is not recommended for indoor use. On the other hand, the Aero GrooVe is a dual purpose bowl, meaning that it can be used both indoors and outdoors. This makes it a great choice for players who want to be able to switch between different playing surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, the Aero GrooVe has the added benefit of being able to be played in multiple positions within a team. This makes it a highly adaptable bowl that can be used by players of different skill levels and positions. Overall, depending on your preferred playing surface and the level of versatility you require from your bowl, either the Henselite Tiger or the Aero GrooVe could be the right choice for you.</p>
