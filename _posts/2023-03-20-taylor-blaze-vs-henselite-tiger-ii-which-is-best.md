<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It's a versatile bowl that can be used on various surfaces and under different weather conditions. This model is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, and it can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. Overall, the Taylor Blaze is a great option for players who need a balanced and adaptable bowl.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow bias lawn bowl designed for indoor and fast outdoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers and those who play as leads on fast outdoor greens. It comes in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and can be difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces. It is recommended to purchase a new set if you are unable to find it second-hand.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II and the Taylor Blaze lawn bowls differ in their level of bias. The Tiger II has a narrow bias, while the Blaze is mid-biased. This means that the Tiger II will have less of a curve when rolled, while the Blaze will have a larger curve. The Blaze falls between the Vector VS and the Ace in the Taylor range, while the Tiger II is between the Tiger TX and the Tiger Pro in the Henselite range.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the ideal use for each bowl varies. The Tiger II is best suited for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens, while the Blaze is suitable for both indoor and outdoor greens. The Tiger II is recommended for lead outdoor bowlers, while the Blaze does not have a specific recommendation. Overall, these differences in bias and recommended use make each bowl unique and suitable for different types of bowlers and greens.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze and the Henselite Tiger II are two popular models of lawn bowls that have unique grip options. The Taylor Blaze comes with the Taylor Premier grip as standard, which is similar to the Progrip but with oblong dimples. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger II features the Heneslite Mega grip as standard, which is an embedded grip set deeper into the bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The difference between the two grips is that an embedded grip, like the one on the Henselite Tiger II, makes the bowl feel smaller in your hand, which can be helpful for bowlers who struggle to grip the bowl properly. Meanwhile, the dimple grip on the Taylor Blaze is a classic style of grip that features small divots along the shoulder of the bowl, designed to provide better grip for your finger tips.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference when it comes to selecting a lawn bowl grip. Bowlers should try both grips and see which one feels more comfortable and provides a better grip for their individual style of play.</p>

The Taylor Blaze is a more affordable option, with a new set costing around £360 and second-hand sets ranging from £210-£230. Meanwhile, the Henselite Tiger II is a more premium option, with a new set costing around £420 and second-hand sets ranging from £200-£290.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

The Henselite Tiger II, on the other hand, is a more expensive option and is designed for more experienced bowlers. It's known for its precision and consistency, making it a popular choice for competitive players.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the Henselite Tiger II and the Taylor Blaze, it's essential to understand the strengths of each bowl. The Taylor Blaze is a mid-biased bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor surfaces. This means that it is a versatile bowl that can be used by bowlers who play in different environments. It's an excellent choice for bowlers who play in various competitions that require different types of surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger II is a narrow biased bowl that is designed for indoor use. It's specifically aimed at lead players who need accuracy and consistency. The narrow bias makes the Tiger II a particularly challenging bowl to master. However, lead players who can master this narrow bias will find that the Tiger II helps them to achieve greater accuracy on the indoor surface.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Taylor Blaze is the ideal bowl for those who want a versatile option that can be used indoors and outdoors.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Blaze and the Henselite Tiger II are great lawn bowls in their own right. The Blaze offers more versatility with its mid-bias, making it ideal for both indoor and outdoor play on a variety of surfaces. On the other hand, the Tiger II is more specialized for narrow bias and faster green conditions, making it perfect for indoor players or leads in outdoor games.
