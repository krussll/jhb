<p>That's why I've put together this blog post comparing two popular models - the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Drakes Pride PRO-50. Throughout this guide, I'll be examining the specs, bias, grip options, and price of each bowl, as well as who they're best suited for. By the time you've finished reading, you'll have a much clearer understanding of which bowl is the right fit for you. So let's dive in!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2723} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-to-wide bias lawn bowl that is great for outdoor play. Its versatility allows it to be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions. Available in sizes 00 to 5, it is a popular choice for UK markets. While it may be hard to find secondhand, it is worth the investment to purchase new for its excellent performance on the green.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. Its versatility makes it usable on various surfaces and conditions. The model is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. Additionally, the PRO-50 can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of the Drakes Pride PRO-50 and the Henselite Tiger EVO lawn bowls is that the Tiger EVO has a midbiased/wide biased profile, while the PRO-50 has a mid-biased profile. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the Tiger EVO is designed for outdoor greens, while the PRO-50 is suitable for both indoor rinks and outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger EVO sits between the Tiger Pro and the Tiger in the Henselite range, while the PRO-50 is positioned between the D-TEC and the XP in the Drakes Pride range. The grip on the PRO-50 is deeper than that of the Professional bowl, which has the same bias. Both lawn bowls are suitable for use by indoor and outdoor bowlers.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while the bias of these two lawn bowls is different, they are both well-suited for use on a variety of surfaces and by a variety of players. The choice between the two will depend on personal preference and the specific conditions in which they will be used.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offer embedded grip options. This type of grip is set deeper into the bowl which can help bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. The Henselite Tiger EVO comes with the Henselite Mega grip while Drakes Pride offers the PRO-50 with their own version of the embedded grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the classic style of grip is the dimple grip. This type of grip features small divots (or dimples) along the shoulder of the bowl to allow your finger tips to sit in them, providing a better grip. The Drakes Pride PRO-50 also offers a dimple grip option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two models will come down to a bowler's personal preference on the style of grip they prefer. Both the embedded grip options and the dimple grip options can be beneficial to different bowlers depending on their needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Henselite Tiger EVO is generally more expensive than the Drakes Pride PRO-50. A set of Henselite Tiger EVO lawn bowls brand new can cost around £400, while a set of Drakes Pride PRO-50 tends to cost around £300. However, if you're on a budget, finding second-hand options may be a better option. Second-hand Henselite Tiger EVO's can be found for around £250-£300, while Drakes Pride PRO-50 can be found in the range of £190-£260. Ultimately, the price difference may not be significant for some, but it may impact the decision-making process for others who have a specific budget in mind. It's important to consider the quality and performance of the bowls in addition to the price before making a decision.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on the above descriptions, it can be inferred that the Henselite Tiger EVO would best suit those who primarily play on outdoor surfaces, while the Drakes Pride PRO-50 would be suitable for those who play on both indoor and outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, lawn bowlers who only play on outdoor surfaces and seek a reliable mid-biased bowl should consider the Henselite Tiger EVO. On the other hand, those who want versatility and a bowl that can perform well on both indoor and outdoor surfaces may want to opt for the Drakes Pride PRO-50.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two popular lawn bowls may come down to personal preference, playing style, and individual requirements. However, understanding their key features and intended uses is an important first step in making an informed decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 are excellent choices for lawn bowlers looking for versatility and durability. While the Henselite Tiger EVO is better suited for outdoor play and may be harder to find on the second-hand market, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 can be used for both indoor and outdoor play and is more readily available on online marketplaces. Ultimately, the choice between the two comes down to personal preference and specific playing needs.</p>
