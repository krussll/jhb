<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer is a lawn bowl with a narrow bias, designed primarily for indoor play. This bowl is best suited for indoor bowlers or lead players on fast outdoor greens. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, the Taylor Lazer can be found for purchase on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride Professional bias is versatile and ideal for indoor and outdoor play on a variety of surfaces and conditions. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only and can be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bias of the Taylor Lazer is narrow, making it suitable for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. However, if you predominantly play outdoors in the UK, the Lazer may not be the best choice. In contrast, the bias of the Drakes Pride Professional is mid-range, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor greens. The Professional falls between the D-TEC and XP in the Drakes Pride range and is suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowlers. Overall, the Lazer is more specialized for certain types of greens while the Professional offers versatility for a wider range of play.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two popular models of lawn bowls on the market, the Taylor Lazer and the Drakes Pride Professional. When it comes to comparing their grips, the Taylor Lazer comes with the Taylor Progrip, which is a dimple grip and considered one of the best around. However, it does not come with the option of an embedded grip, which is said to be better than a dimple grip.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride Professional only offers their standard dimple grip. While a dimple grip is a classic style and provides small divots for your fingertips to rest in, an embedded grip goes deeper into the bowl, making it ideal for bowlers who struggle to grip the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice of grip ultimately comes down to personal preference and individual needs. Some may prefer the Taylor Lazer and its dimple grip, while others may find the deeper set embedded grip of the Drakes Pride Professional more suitable for their game.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Taylor Lazer and the Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowls, one can see that both have a similar price point when purchased new, at around £290. However, when looking at the second-hand market, it is clear that the Drakes Pride Professional offers a wider range of prices, with options between £60 to £210. On the other hand, the second-hand market for the Taylor Lazer seems to have a narrower range, with prices hovering around £150 to £170.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the initial cost of the lawn bowls may seem like a significant factor, it is essential to consider the longevity of the product. Both the Taylor Lazer and the Drakes Pride Professional are renowned for their durability and performance, meaning that investing in a high-quality lawn bowl can save money in the long run. The decision ultimately comes down to personal preference, playing style, and budget. However, it is clear that both the Taylor Lazer and the Drakes Pride Professional offer excellent value for money and are two of the most popular lawn bowls on the market.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on the descriptions, the Taylor Lazer would best suit indoor bowlers who primarily play lead. Its narrow bias is optimized for indoor surfaces, and may not perform as well outdoors. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride Professional is suitable for both indoor and outdoor surfaces, making it a more versatile option. Its mid-bias also allows for more flexibility in shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between the two depends on the individual bowler's style and preferred playing surfaces. Those who primarily play indoors and lead may prefer the Taylor Lazer, while those who play both indoors and outdoors may opt for the more versatile Drakes Pride Professional.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both the Taylor Lazer and Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowls are great options for indoor and outdoor play, the Drakes Pride Professional stands out as the more versatile option. It has a mid-bias which makes it suitable for use on various surfaces and conditions, whereas the Taylor Lazer is best for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. Additionally, both bowls are available in the same range of sizes and can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and the specific conditions you will be playing on.</p>
