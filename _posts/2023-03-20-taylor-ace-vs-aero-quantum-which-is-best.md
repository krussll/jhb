<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2690} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace boasts versatility as a mid-biased lawn bowl that can be used both indoors and outdoors. Its range of sizes, from 00 to 5, caters specifically to the UK market. For those looking for a more affordable option, second-hand Taylor Ace bowls can also be found on online marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum lawn bowl is a narrow biased bowl that is designed for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. It is ideal for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. This model is only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, and it can be difficult to find on online marketplaces. Consequently, it is advisable to purchase this model new from a reputable supplier.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparing the bias of the Taylor Ace and the Aero Quantum lawn bowl, we can see that they differ in their bias characteristics. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2814} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace is a mid-biased bowl, which means it has a moderate curve when played. It is suited for both indoor and outdoor bowling, making it a versatile option for bowlers. On the other hand, the Aero Quantum is a narrow biased bowl, which means it has a sharper curve when played. It is also suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowling, but may be better suited for more experienced players who can handle the narrow bias.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Ace and the Aero Quantum are quality lawn bowls, but their bias characteristics differ. The Taylor Ace has a moderate bias, making it a good option for most playing conditions, while the Aero Quantum has a sharper narrow bias, making it more suitable for players who can handle the extra curve. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on a bowler's personal preference and skill level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Ace and Aero Quantum lawn bowls offer various grip options to suit bowlers' preferences. The Taylor Ace has the Progrip and Taylor Xtreme as standard options, while Aero offers a dimple, embedded, and non-gripped option at no extra cost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The embedded grip on the Taylor Ace is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in hand, which can assist bowlers who struggle with grip. On the other hand, the dimple grip on the Aero Quantum features small divots that provide a classic and comfortable grip for most bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both brands offer solid grip options, and it's up to the individual bowler to determine which is best for them based on their individual preferences and needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the price of the Aero Quantum lawn bowl and the Taylor Ace, there are some differences to consider. The Taylor Ace is more affordable, with a new set costing £360 and second-hand sets ranging from £160 to £230. On the other hand, the Aero Quantum is a bit pricier, with a new set costing around £400, and the second-hand market prices ranging from £300 to £360 if you're lucky to find them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the Aero Quantum is more expensive, it's worth noting that it's a relatively new model that has proven to be popular among professional bowlers. Its unique design and advanced technology make it an investment for those who want to take their game to the next level. Meanwhile, the Taylor Ace is a tried-and-true classic that has been around for decades and is known for its consistency and reliability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between the Aero Quantum and Taylor Ace will depend on individual preferences, needs, and budget. However, it's important to keep in mind the potential long-term benefits and performance improvements that come with investing in a higher-priced set of bowls like the Aero Quantum.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are a beginner or play on a variety of different surfaces, the Taylor Ace may be the better choice for you. Its mid-bias makes it versatile for indoor and outdoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are an experienced bowler looking for a specific bias for your playing style, the Aero Quantum may be a better option. Its narrow bias and dual purpose design make it a strong choice for both indoor and outdoor play, but it is especially suited for lead bowlers in outdoor conditions. It is also a popular choice for team play indoors due to its flexibility in various positions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the Taylor Ace and the Aero Quantum, it's important to consider the intended usage and specific features of each bowl. While both lawn bowls are available in various sizes and designed for UK markets, the Taylor Ace is more versatile and can be used in a wider range of conditions. In contrast, the Aero Quantum is tailored for indoor play or faster outdoor greens, making it a better option for more experienced or competitive bowlers. While the Taylor Ace can be found on second-hand marketplaces such as eBay, the Aero Quantum is primarily available new, and may be harder to come by. Ultimately, the choice between these two popular models will depend on the individual player's preference and specific needs.</p>
