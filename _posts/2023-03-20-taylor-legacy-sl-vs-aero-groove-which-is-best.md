<p>We'll look at everything from the specs to the price, and I'll even give you some insight on who each bowl would be best suited for. So, by the end of this guide, you'll have everything you need to make the right choice for you. Let's get started!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL is a wide bias lawn bowl designed for outdoor play on a variety of surfaces. Its bias is best suited for skips and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. While it may no longer be in production, the Taylor Legacy SL can still be found on online marketplaces like eBay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero GrooVe is a mid-biased lawn bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. Its versatile nature allows it to be used on various surfaces and conditions. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, the Aero GrooVe may be difficult to find in online second-hand marketplaces and is best purchased new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparing the bias of the Taylor Legacy SL and the Aero GrooVe lawn bowls, it is evident that they are designed for different playing environments. The Legacy SL is a wide biased bowl, best suited for outdoor greens and all outdoor surfaces. On the other hand, the GrooVe is a mid-biased bowl that is ideal for indoor rinks and outdoor greens, suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both bowls have their unique advantages, the Legacy SL's wider bias provides added stability on outdoor surfaces. Meanwhile, the GrooVe's mid-bias makes it easier to control on indoor rinks, where precision is key. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the player's preferred playing environment and personal style of play.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the grips, the Aero GrooVe lawn bowl stands out by offering more options than the Taylor Legacy SL. With Aero, you can choose between a dimple, embedded, or non-gripped option, and all grips come as standard at no extra cost. In contrast, the Taylor Legacy SL only provides the Taylor Progrip as standard, which is a well-regarded dimple grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While an embedded grip is better than a dimple grip, the Taylor Legacy SL does not offer this option. An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand, which can be beneficial for bowlers who struggle to grip the bowl properly. In contrast, the Aero GrooVe offers all grip options on their entire range, including the popular Aero Quantum and Aero Sonic models.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, if you're looking for more grip options, the Aero GrooVe would be the way to go, while the Taylor Legacy SL is a solid choice if you prefer a classic dimple grip. The presence of an embedded grip is an advantage over the Taylor Legacy SL, but it depends on individual preferences and needs.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Taylor Legacy SL and Aero GrooVe lawn bowls, it's clear that the latter is more expensive. The Taylor Legacy SL can be bought new for £290, whereas the Aero GrooVe is priced at around £400. However, if you're in the market for a used set, the Taylor Legacy SL is a much more affordable option, with prices ranging from £100-£160 for second-hand bowls. On the other hand, a second-hand set of Aero GrooVe's can still be quite pricey, typically costing between £300-£360.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, it's important to consider both the initial and long-term costs when choosing between these two models. While the Aero GrooVe may have a higher upfront cost, it may be worth it for those who prioritize high-performance equipment and plan to use their bowls for many years to come. However, those on a tight budget or new to the sport may find that the Taylor Legacy SL offers a more accessible and affordable option.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to choosing between the Taylor Legacy SL and the Aero GrooVe lawn bowls, it really boils down to your bowling preferences and where you plan to play. The Taylor Legacy SL is best suited for outdoor play and is designed with a wide bias. If you typically play outdoors and want a bowl that can handle a variety of different greens, this might be the best option for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Aero GrooVe is a dual-purpose bowl that can handle both indoor and outdoor play. It offers more flexibility in terms of how it can be played in team positions, making it a great choice for those who like to mix up their playing styles. If you're looking for a bowl that can adapt to different greens and play scenarios, then the Aero GrooVe might be the better option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, choosing the right lawn bowl depends on what you're looking for in terms of playing style, green conditions, and versatility. Both the Taylor Legacy SL and the Aero GrooVe have their strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to consider your personal preferences before making a decision.</p>
