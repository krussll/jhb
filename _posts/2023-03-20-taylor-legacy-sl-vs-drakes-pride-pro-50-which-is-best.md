<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 have different biases, making them suitable for different playing styles and environments. The Legacy SL is a wide biased bowl that is best used on outdoor greens, while the PRO-50 is a mid-biased bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of grip, the Legacy SL has a standard grip while the PRO-50 has a deeper grip. This may appeal to players who prefer a certain type of grip on their bowl. Additionally, the Legacy SL is described as being between two other bowls in the Taylor range, whereas the PRO-50 is described as being between two other bowls in the Drakes Pride range.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the grips of lawn bowls, the Taylor Legacy SL and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offer two different options. The Taylor Legacy SL comes with the standard Taylor Progrip, which is a dimple grip that many consider to be one of the best around. However, the Legacy SL does not offer an embedded grip option, which may be a disadvantage for some bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 comes with the option of an embedded grip, which is set deeper into the bowl to make it feel smaller in your hand. This can be an advantage for bowlers who struggle with grip issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, while the Taylor Legacy SL offers a classic dimple grip and the Taylor Progrip, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offers the option of an embedded grip for those who prefer it. Ultimately, the choice between these two models may come down to personal preference and individual bowling needs.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Taylor Legacy SL and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowls, there are some similarities and differences. Both models can be purchased new for around the same price range of £290-£300. However, there is a significant discrepancy when it comes to buying second hand. The Taylor Legacy SL can be purchased for a lower price of around £100-£160, while the Drakes Pride PRO-50 will cost around £190-£260.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This difference in price may be a crucial factor for bowlers who are looking to purchase high-quality lawn bowls without breaking the bank. The Taylor Legacy SL may be a better option for those on a tighter budget or who would like to purchase a quality bowl at a lower price point. Meanwhile, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 may be a better choice for those who are willing to invest a bit more money to ensure they have the latest and greatest in lawn bowl technology.

The Taylor Legacy SL is ideal for outdoor play as it has a wider bias, while the Drakes Pride PRO-50 is suitable for both indoor and outdoor surfaces as it has a mid-bias.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

However, if you play on both indoor and outdoor surfaces, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 would be a better choice. It is important to consider the surface you will be playing on and choose a bowl with the appropriate bias to ensure the best performance. Ultimately, the choice between these two popular models will depend on the individual player's preferences and the type of surface they will be playing on.</p>
