<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid is a wide biased lawn bowl that is perfect for outdoor play, especially on all outdoor surfaces. It is ideal for skips due to its wide bias. This model is only available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market, and it can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 is a mid-biased bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. Its versatility makes it adaptable to a range of surfaces and conditions, making it an ideal choice for bowlers looking for a reliable and adaptable option. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, this bowl can be found on second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid lawn bowl is a wide bias bowl that is ideal for outdoor greens. It is best suited for players who spend most of their time playing outdoors. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowl is a mid-biased bowl that has the same bias as the popular Professional bowl. It is suitable for both indoor and outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Lignoid has a wider bias, the PRO-50 has a deeper grip, which can provide better control for indoor bowlers. Both bowls have their benefits depending on the playing surface and preference of the player. It is important for players to understand these differences and to choose a bowl that suits their playing style and environment.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the grips of two popular models of lawn bowls, the Taylor Lignoid and the Drakes Pride PRO-50, there are distinct differences. The Taylor Lignoid comes with the Taylor Progrip, which is a classic dimple grip that many bowlers prefer. However, the Taylor Lignoid doesn't offer an embedded grip option, which can be a drawback for some bowlers who struggle with grip.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offers an embedded grip option, which can be beneficial for bowlers who have trouble holding the bowl properly. This grip is set deeper into the bowl, which can make it feel smaller in the hand. This, in turn, can improve grip for those who struggle with it. Overall, both grips have their advantages and disadvantages, and it ultimately comes down to personal preference and what works best for each individual bowler.</p>

However, when it comes to second-hand options, the Taylor Lignoid is slightly more affordable, with prices ranging from £90-130.
