<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid is a wide biased bowl suitable for outdoor play and is ideal for skips. It is available in sizes ranging from 00 to 5 but is only sold in the UK market. It can also be found on second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide bias lawn bowl designed for outdoor play on any surface. It is ideal for skips and is available in sizes ranging from 00 to 5 for the UK market only. The Tiger is not commonly found on online second-hand marketplaces, so it's best to purchase them new. Overall, the Henselite Tiger is a high-quality and versatile lawn bowl that is suitable for a range of outdoor play styles.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger and the Taylor Lignoid lawn bowls are wide biased and ideal for outdoor greens. However, the Lignoid is considered the widest bowl in the Taylor range while the Tiger is the widest in the Henselite range. Additionally, the Legacy SL variation of the Lignoid is recommended for all outdoor surfaces but not predominantly indoor play.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of bias, it's difficult to determine a clear winner between the two models as they are both wide biased. However, players may have personal preferences based on the bowling conditions and individual playing style. Ultimately, it's important for players to try out different lawn bowls before making a decision on which one works best for them.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid and Henselite Tiger models of lawn bowls have different grip options. The Taylor Lignoid comes with the Taylor Progrip, a dimple grip, which is highly regarded. However, it does not offer an embedded grip option. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger has the Henselite Mega grip, an embedded grip, which is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the hand. This is beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the two grips have different advantages, with the Taylor Progrip being a classic option and the Henselite Mega grip being embedded for a tighter grip. When choosing between these lawn bowls, bowlers should consider their own grip and comfort levels to determine which grip model suits them best.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Taylor Lignoid and the Henselite Tiger lawn bowls, it is clear that the Henselite Tiger is the more expensive option. A brand new Henselite Tiger costs around £400, whereas a new Taylor Lignoid can be purchased for £290. However, it is important to note that the Taylor Lignoid is often sold second hand for around £90-130, making it a more affordable option for those on a budget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the second-hand price of a Henselite Tiger II can range from £200 to £690, which is significantly more expensive than a second-hand Taylor Lignoid. Ultimately, the choice between these two models may come down to personal preference and budget. While the Henselite Tiger may offer some additional features or benefits, the Taylor Lignoid can be a more affordable option for those looking to save money.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lignoid and the Henselite Tiger are designed for outdoor play and have a wide bias, making them suitable for players who prefer to play on larger, faster greens. However, the Taylor Lignoid is known for its superior stability and is therefore ideal for players who are looking for a ball that provides consistency and accuracy. The Henselite Tiger, on the other hand, is more suitable for those who are looking for a more versatile ball that can be used on a variety of different surfaces.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both of these models are high-quality and dependable lawn bowls that are well-suited to outdoor play. However, players looking for stability and accuracy may find the Taylor Lignoid to be the better choice, while those seeking versatility and adaptability may be more drawn to the Henselite Tiger. Ultimately, the decision between these two models will depend on the player's individual preferences and the specific conditions of the greens they play on.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Lignoid and the Henselite Tiger are great options for outdoor lawn bowling. They have similar features, including wide bias and suitability for outdoor surfaces and skips. However, the key difference lies in availability. The Taylor Lignoid can be easily found on online second-hand marketplaces, while the Henselite Tiger is harder to come by and will likely need to be purchased new.
