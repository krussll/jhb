<p>I'll break down their specs, bias, grip options, price, and who they're best suited for. By the end of this guide, you'll know exactly which bowl will work best for you!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL is a lawn bowl designed for outdoor play and has a wide bias, making it perfect for skips. It is suitable for all outdoor surfaces and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. Additionally, the bowl can be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX is a narrow biased lawn bowl designed for indoor play. With a bias ideal for fast outdoor greens and an available size range of 00 to 5 (for the UK market only), this model is best suited for indoor bowlers or those who play lead. However, buyers should note that it can be challenging to find second-hand versions of the Henselite Tiger TX, so purchasing new may be necessary.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the Henselite Tiger TX lawn bowl and the Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowl is their bias. The Tiger TX has a narrow bias, making it ideal for indoor rinks and indoor bowlers. In contrast, the Legacy SL has a wide bias and is suitable for all outdoor surfaces. The Legacy SL should be avoided indoors, while the Tiger TX should be avoided outdoors in the UK.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both bowls have their strengths, choosing the right bowl depends on what type of surface you plan to play on. The Tiger TX is perfect for indoor bowlers, while the Legacy SL is designed for outdoor greens. Ultimately, it's best to test out both bowls on different surfaces to see which one feels most comfortable for your playing style.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL and the Henselite Tiger TX both have well-known grips, but they differ in their design. The Taylor Legacy SL features a Progrip, which is a classic dimple grip known for its reliability. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger TX has a Mega grip that is embedded deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the hand. This is particularly helpful for those who struggle with gripping the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While an embedded grip is preferred by some, a dimple grip like the Progrip remains a popular choice due to its effectiveness. The dimpled design allows for a better grip by allowing fingertips to sit in the divots. However, an embedded grip provides an additional layer of grip as it is deeper and conforms better to the hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between the two grips will depend on personal preference and individual needs. Bowlers who value a classic grip and do not require extra support may prefer the Taylor Legacy SL with its Progrip. However, those who require more grip and support may prefer the Henselite Tiger TX's deeper and embedded Mega grip.</p>
