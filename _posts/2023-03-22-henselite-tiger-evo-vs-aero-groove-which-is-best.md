<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl suitable for outdoor play. It is versatile and performs well on a range of surfaces and conditions. Available in sizes 00 to 5, this model is only sold in the UK, and it can be difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces. Therefore, purchasing new may be your best option.</p>

<p>The Aero GrooVe is a mid-biased lawn bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It is a versatile bowl that can be used on different surfaces and conditions. The sizes available for the UK market range from 00 to 5. It is worth noting that the Aero GrooVe is not commonly found on online second-hand marketplaces, so purchasing them new may be the best option.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Aero GrooVe lawn bowls are mid-biased, making them versatile and suitable for a variety of playing surfaces. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Tiger EVO has a wider bias than the GrooVe, making it better suited for outdoor greens. Additionally, the Tiger EVO is designed to provide consistent performance across different outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the GrooVe is a better fit for indoor rinks and outdoor greens. Its mid-bias allows for ease of use for both indoor and outdoor bowlers. Additionally, the GrooVe is positioned between the Quantum and the Sonic bowls in the Aero range, making it a great option for intermediate bowlers who want a balanced performance.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while both the Tiger EVO and the GrooVe have their unique qualities, it ultimately comes down to personal preference and the playing surface. Bowlers should consider their individual needs and preferences before selecting a lawn bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Henselite Tiger EVO comes with the Henselite Mega embedded grip as standard, while the Aero GrooVe offers a range of grip options including a dimple grip, embedded grip, and non-gripped option that come at no extra cost. An embedded grip is best for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl, as it sits deeper in the bowl and makes it feel smaller in your hand. Alternatively, the dimple grip is a classic option where the bowl has small divots along the shoulder that allow for better grip for your fingertips. Ultimately, the choice between the Henselite Tiger EVO and Aero GrooVe will depend on individual bowlers' preferences for grip style and what feels most comfortable in their hands.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, both the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Aero GrooVe fall into a similar price range. A brand new set of either bowl can be purchased for around £400, with second-hand options costing slightly less at around £250-£360. Ultimately, the decision between the two models should not be based on price alone, but should take into account factors such as feel, grip and performance to find the best fit for the individual player.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>Both the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Aero GrooVe lawn bowls have unique features that make them suitable for different types of players. The Henselite Tiger EVO is ideal for those who mostly play outdoors, whereas the Aero GrooVe is perfect for players who want to play both indoors and outdoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mid-biased nature of the Henselite Tiger EVO makes it well-suited for experienced players who prefer outdoor surfaces, such as grass or carpet. In contrast, the Aero GrooVe's dual-purpose design enables it to perform well both indoors and outdoors, making it a versatile option for players who participate in both types of games.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of team play, the Aero GrooVe offers greater flexibility, as it can be played in multiple positions. This feature makes it an ideal choice for those in teams that require frequent changes to roles or positions. The Henselite Tiger EVO, on the other hand, is more suited to individual players who prefer a reliable and consistent bowl on outdoor surfaces.</p>
