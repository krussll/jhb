<p>I'll be breaking down their specifications, bias, grip options, and price range, and even advise you on which bowl is best suited for you. By the end of this guide, you'll have all the knowledge you need to make an informed decision on selecting the perfect lawn bowl for you. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2732} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX is a narrow biased lawn bowl that is best suited for indoor play or for use as a lead bowl on fast outdoor greens. It is only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, making it relatively difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay. As a high-performing bowl, it is recommended to purchase the Tiger TX new.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a versatile mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl suitable for outdoor play on various surfaces and conditions. It is available in sizes ranging from 00 to 5 for the UK market only, and can be challenging to find on online second-hand marketplaces. Therefore, purchasing new may be the best option if you prefer this model.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX and Henselite Tiger EVO lawn bowls have different biases. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2835} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger TX is a narrow biased bowl that is best suited for indoor rinks and indoor bowlers. It is the narrowest biased bowl in the Henselite range, and it should be avoided if you predominantly play outdoors in the UK. In contrast, the Tiger EVO is a mid-biased to wide biased bowl that is ideal for outdoor greens and suitable for all outdoor surfaces. It is located between the Tiger Pro and the Tiger in the Henselite range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, if you play primarily on indoor surfaces, the Henselite Tiger TX would be the bowl of choice due to its narrower bias. On the other hand, if you play predominantly outdoors, the Henselite Tiger EVO would be the better option due to its wider bias and suitability for outdoor greens. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2838} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is essential to select the correct bias in a lawn bowl to maximize performance and achieve optimal results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger TX and Tiger EVO come with the Henselite Mega grip as standard, which is an embedded grip set deeper into the bowl. This makes them ideal for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. However, the Henselite Tiger EVO has an additional dimple grip running along the shoulder of the bowl, which provides an extra level of grip for the bowler's fingers. The Henselite Tiger TX does not have this feature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both lawn bowls offer a solid grip with the Henselite Mega grip, but the added dimple grip of the Henselite Tiger EVO may give it an advantage for bowlers who want some extra texture on the bowl for better control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, both the Henselite Tiger TX and the Henselite Tiger EVO are in a similar range. The Tiger TX is slightly pricier, with a price of around £420 brand new and £260-310 when bought second hand. On the other hand, the Tiger EVO costs around £400 brand new and £250-£300 second hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the price difference may seem minimal, it is important to note that over time, the cost of a set of lawn bowls can add up. Additionally, the availability of second hand sets at a lower price point could be a deciding factor for some buyers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between the Henselite Tiger TX and the Henselite Tiger EVO may come down to personal preference rather than price. Both bowls are popular models with their own unique features, and it is important to consider factors such as size, weight, and grip when making a decision.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger TX and the Henselite Tiger EVO are popular models of lawn bowls, but they are designed for different purposes. The Henselite Tiger TX is a narrow biased bowl intended for indoor bowling and is best suited for players who frequently play lead. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-biased bowl that can be used on all surfaces, but is targeted towards outdoor gameplay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are primarily an indoor bowler and tend to play lead, the Henselite Tiger TX would be the ideal choice for you. The bowl is narrow biased, which makes it easier to get a consistent line and length. However, if you play outdoors more frequently, you may want to consider the Henselite Tiger EVO instead. The mid-bias on this bowl makes it more versatile, allowing you to use it for various shots on any surface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between the Henselite Tiger TX and Henselite Tiger EVO depends on your playing style and the type of surface you use. If you prefer indoor bowling, the Henselite Tiger TX is the perfect choice, while the Henselite Tiger EVO is a more versatile option that can be used on any surface, making it the ideal choice for outdoor players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After comparing the Henselite Tiger TX and the Henselite Tiger EVO, it is clear that both models have unique qualities that make them ideal for different types of bowling. The Tiger TX is best suited for indoor play and fast outdoor greens, while the Tiger EVO is more versatile and can be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions. Both models are only available in the UK market and can be difficult to find secondhand online. Ultimately, the choice between the two models will depend on the bowler's personal preferences and the type of play they engage in.</p>
