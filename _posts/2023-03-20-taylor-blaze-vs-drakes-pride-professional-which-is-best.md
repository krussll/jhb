<p>We'll be comparing the bowls based on their specs, bias, grip options, price, and who they'll be best suited for. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clear idea of which lawn bowl is the perfect fit for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze is a highly versatile lawn bowl suited for both indoor and outdoor play. Its mid-bias makes it ideal for a range of surface and conditions, making it a popular choice among players. Available in sizes 00 to 5, the Taylor Blaze is a UK-market exclusive, though it can be found on second-hand online marketplaces such as eBay. Overall, the Taylor Blaze offers reliable performance and versatility, making it a top choice for players of all levels.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride Professional model is a mid-biased lawn bowl, suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It is a versatile model that can be used in various conditions and on different surfaces. The Drakes Pride Professional is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only in the UK market. Additionally, this model can also be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on the information provided, it appears that both the Taylor Blaze and Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowls have a mid-bias and are suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. The Blaze is placed between the Vector VS and Ace in the Taylor range, whereas the Professional is placed between the D-TEC and XP in the Drakes Pride range. Both bowls are described as ideal for different playing surfaces, but are relatively similar in terms of bias and suitability. As such, it is difficult to determine a significant bias difference between the two based on this information alone. Further research or testing may be needed to identify any potential variations in bias between the two bowls.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grip options, the Taylor Blaze gives players the choice between the oblong dimples of the Premier grip and the highly regarded Progrip. However, it doesn’t include the option of an embedded grip, which can be a drawback for some bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, Drakes Pride only offers their Professional model with the classic and reliable dimple grip. While a dimple grip is a tried and true style of grip, it may not suit every bowler’s preferences or needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, which grip is best for you comes down to personal preference and what feels most comfortable in your hand. It may be worth trying out both models before making a decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Taylor Blaze and the Drakes Pride Professional Lawn Bowls, the Blaze is the more expensive option. The Blaze can be purchased new for around £360, while the Professional is priced at around £290. However, it's worth noting that second-hand Blazes are selling for around £210-£230, while second-hand Professionals can be found for just £60-£210.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the price difference, both of these lawn bowls are popular choices among players due to their quality and durability. While the Blaze is more expensive, it's considered by some to be the 'Rolls Royce' of lawn bowls, and its performance on the green is unmatched by many other models. On the other hand, the Professional is a more affordable option that still provides superior quality, making it a great choice for players who are looking to save money but don't want to compromise on performance. Ultimately, the choice between these two models comes down to individual preferences and priorities.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both the Taylor Blaze and the Drakes Pride Professional have very similar descriptions, there are a few differences that may make one more suited for certain players over others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze may be the better choice for those who prefer a slightly smaller and lighter bowl, as it is available in sizes 00 to 4 and ranges from 2lb 4oz to 2lb 10oz. It is also known for its accuracy on indoor surfaces, making it a top choice for indoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride Professional may be more appealing to those who favor a slightly larger bowl, as it is available in sizes 00 to 5 and ranges from 2lb 6oz to 3lb. It is also known for its stability on outdoor surfaces, making it a top choice for outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Blaze and the Drakes Pride Professional are great options for players of all levels, but personal preference and play style may lend itself better to one over the other.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Blaze and the Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowls are excellent options for both indoor and outdoor play. They have similar features, such as mid-bias and versatile use on various surfaces and conditions. However, the main difference seems to be their availability, with both being only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, but the Taylor Blaze being more commonly found on second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.
