<p>Throughout this post, I'll cover important aspects such as the specs, bias, grip options, pricing, and who each bowl is best suited for. By the time you finish reading, you'll have the knowledge you need to select the ideal bowl for your game.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International lawn bowl is a highly versatile and adaptable model that boasts a mid-to-wide bias for optimal outdoor play. With its excellent performance on various surfaces and conditions, the Taylor International is popular among experienced bowlers looking for a reliable and consistent option. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, this bowl can be found both in traditional retail stores and online marketplaces such as eBay. Its durability and compatibility with different playing styles make it a sought-after choice for both casual and competitive players alike.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride XP is a wide biased bowl designed for outdoor play, that offers great versatility on all types of outdoor surfaces. It's an ideal choice for skips and is available in sizes 00-5 for the UK market. The Drakes Pride XP is a premium product that's hard to come by on online second-hand marketplaces, so it's recommended to buy them new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to bias, the Taylor International and Drakes Pride XP lawn bowls are quite similar. Both are designed for outdoor greens and are suitable for all surfaces. The primary difference is that the International is considered midbiased or wide biased, while the XP is the widest bowl in the Drakes Pride range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both bowls would be suitable for players who prefer a wider bias. However, those who are looking for a midbiased option may find the International to be a better fit. Ultimately, the choice between these two bowls will depend on a player's individual preferences and playing style.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grips, the Taylor International comes with their Progrip, which is widely regarded as one of the best dimple grips available. However, it doesn't offer an embedded grip option, which is considered superior to a dimple grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP only comes with their standard dimple grip, which is a classic style of grip that uses small divots to give you a better grip. While this grip may feel comfortable for many bowlers, those who have difficulty gripping the bowl properly may find that an embedded grip, like the one offered by other models, is a better option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the price comparison between the Taylor International and the Drakes Pride XP lawn bowls, it is clear that the Taylor International is the more expensive option. A new Taylor International can be purchased for £360, while a new Drakes Pride XP can be purchased for around £290. However, when it comes to secondhand options, the prices tend to even out. A secondhand Taylor International can be bought for around £100-£190, while a secondhand Drakes Pride XP can be bought for around £140-£250.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is important to note that price isn't the only factor to consider when choosing between these two lawn bowls. The Taylor International is known for its high quality and precision, making it a top choice among serious lawn bowlers. The Drakes Pride XP is also a popular option, with a strong reputation for accuracy and consistency on the green. Ultimately, the choice between these two bowls will come down to personal preference and playing style.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are a lawn bowler who plays predominantly outdoors, then the Taylor International may be the bowl for you. With its mid-bias and versatility across different surfaces, it caters to a wider range of conditions. However, if you play exclusively outdoors, then the Drakes Pride XP would be your best bet due to its high level of bias that caters to outdoor gameplay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to note that the Drakes Pride XP should be avoided for indoor play, so if you play both indoor and outdoor, the Taylor International may be the safer choice for you. Ultimately, choosing the right bowl comes down to personal preference and skill level, so be sure to try out both options before deciding on one.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor International and the Drakes Pride XP are great options for outdoor lawn bowls. While the Taylor International is more versatile and can be found on second-hand marketplaces, the Drakes Pride XP's wide-bias makes it ideal for skips and all outdoor surfaces. Ultimately, the choice between the two will come down to personal preference and playing style.</p>
