<p>The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow biased bowl that is suitable for indoor and fast outdoor play. It is recommended for indoor bowlers or lead players on fast outdoor greens. The bowl is only available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market and may be difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces. As a result, purchasing a brand new set may be necessary.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II lawn bowl is a narrow biased bowl, making it ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II has an embedded grip which makes it feel smaller in your hand, making it ideal for bowlers who have problems gripping the bowl properly. On the other hand, the Aero Sonic offers multiple grip options, including a dimple, embedded grip, and a non-gripped option. All grips come as standard and cost nothing extra, making it a popular choice for those who want more flexibility in their grip preference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both models offer unique grip options, allowing bowlers to choose the best fit for their needs. While the Henselite Tiger II offers a reliable embedded grip, the Aero Sonic takes it one step further with multiple options to choose from. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and what feels comfortable in your hand during play.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, both the Henselite Tiger II and the Aero Sonic are similarly priced. The Henselite Tiger II comes in at around £420 brand new and £200-290 second hand. On the other hand, the Aero Sonic costs about £400 new and £300-£360 second hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the difference in price might seem minimal, it's important to keep in mind that many lawn bowl enthusiasts are fiercely loyal to either Henselite or Aero. So, even a small price difference could affect their purchasing decision. Ultimately, it's up to the individual player to decide which model suits their needs better, based on factors such as grip, bias, and size.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The comparison between the Henselite Tiger II and the Aero Sonic lawn bowl boils down to the specific needs and preferences of the bowlers. The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow biased bowl suited for indoor bowlers and leads playing on faster outdoor surfaces. On the other hand, the Aero Sonic is an outdoor bowl that players can use in multiple positions in a team. It is most suitable for anyone who wants to primarily play outdoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're an indoor bowler or a lead, the Henselite Tiger II is an excellent option for you. It has a narrow bias, which means it's perfect for longer distances on fast outdoor surfaces. However, if you prefer playing outdoors, the Aero Sonic should be your choice. Not only is it a great outdoor bowl, but it is also flexible to be played with in multiple positions in a team. Therefore, the Aero Sonic is best suited for anyone who wants to primarily play outdoors and avoid playing indoors.</p>
