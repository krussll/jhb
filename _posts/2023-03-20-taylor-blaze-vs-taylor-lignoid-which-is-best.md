<p>That's why in this blog post, I'll be comparing two popular models - the Taylor Blaze and the Taylor Lignoid. Throughout this guide, I'll be breaking down the specs, bias, grip options, price, and which option is best for different types of players. By the end of this guide, you'll feel confident in your decision and ready to hit the green with your new lawn bowl!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. Its versatility allows for use on various surfaces and conditions, making it an ideal choice for bowlers looking for a reliable option. The Taylor Blaze comes in sizes 00 to 5, but it is only available for the UK market. If you're interested in getting this bowl, you can find it on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<p>The Taylor Lignoid is a wide-biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. It's suitable for all outdoor surfaces and is particularly well-suited for skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, this bowl can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze and the Taylor Lignoid have different biases, which makes them suitable for different environments. The Blaze is a mid-biased bowl that is suitable for both indoor rinks and outdoor greens. It is ideal for bowlers who play in a variety of environments. On the other hand, the Lignoid is a wide biased bowl, which means it is best suited for outdoor greens. It is also the widest bowl in the Taylor range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are an indoor bowler, the Blaze would be a better choice since it is suitable for both indoor and outdoor environments. However, if you primarily play outdoors, the Lignoid would be the better choice due to its wide bias. It is also important to note that the Legacy SL, which is also a Taylor bowl, is suitable for all outdoor surfaces but should be avoided if you play predominately indoors. Overall, choosing the right bowl depends on your playing environment and your personal preferences.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze and Taylor Lignoid are both popular models of lawn bowls. When it comes to grips, the Taylor Blaze comes with the Taylor Premier grip while the Taylor Lignoid comes with the Taylor Progrip. Both grips offer different benefits for bowlers. The Premier grip has oblong dimples while the Progrip has circular dimples.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the Taylor Blaze does not come with the option of an embedded grip while the Lignoid does not come with the option for this grip either. However, an embedded grip is better for bowlers who have trouble holding the bowl properly as it makes the bowl feel smaller in their hand. On the other hand, the classic dimple grip is designed for your fingertips to sit in the dimples to provide better grip. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and the needs of the bowler.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the price comparison between the Taylor Blaze and the Taylor Lignoid, there is a significant difference. The Taylor Lignoid is considerably cheaper than the Taylor Blaze, with a new set costing around £290 compared to the Blaze's £360 price tag. Additionally, the second-hand market for Lignoids stands at around £90-£130, whereas the Blaze is around £210-£230.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it's worth noting that the price difference between the two models is somewhat reflected in the quality of materials used. The Blaze is made from denser materials that promise to give the player more control for putting and rolling, while the Lignoid is made from a softer, more pliable composite. This material choice gives Lignoids more "swing," which can be a desirable trait depending on a player's style of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the price difference between the two models gives players some flexibility in their choice of equipment. Those looking for a budget-friendly option may find the Taylor Lignoid appealing, while others may prefer the finer handling of the more expensive Taylor Blaze. It seems that when it comes to lawn bowls, as with many sports, the right equipment can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparing The Taylor Blaze and The Taylor Lignoid lawn bowls, it is important to consider the type of surface you will be playing on. The Blaze is a mid-biased bowl that works well on both indoor and outdoor surfaces, making it a versatile choice. On the other hand, the Lignoid is a wide biased bowl that is designed for players who exclusively play outdoors. If you play mainly on outdoor surfaces, the Lignoid would be the best option for you due to its wider bias.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, if you are a beginner or intermediate player, the mid-biased Taylor Blaze is a great choice. Its versatility and ease of use make it a popular choice for many players. However, if you are a more experienced player looking for a challenge, the wider bias of The Taylor Lignoid can give you more control and precision when playing. Ultimately, both bowls have their advantages and it is important to consider your level of play and the surface you will be playing on when choosing between them.</p>
