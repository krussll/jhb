<h2>Spec</h2>

<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl suitable for outdoor play. It's versatile enough to be used on different surfaces and conditions and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. However, it's difficult to find second-hand as these bowls are typically bought new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze lawn bowl is a mid-biased bowl, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2819} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It sits between the Vector VS and the Ace in the Taylor range and is ideal for bowlers of all levels. Meanwhile, the Henselite Tiger EVO is a midbiased/wide biased bowl, making it more suitable for outdoor play. It sits between the Tiger Pro and the Tiger in the Henselite range, and is suitable for all outdoor surfaces.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the bias of these two lawn bowls, it is clear that the Blaze has a more moderate bias, while the Tiger EVO is designed with a greater amount of bias. The Blaze is a versatile bowl that can be played on both indoor and outdoor surfaces, while the Tiger EVO is optimized for outdoor greens. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two bowls will depend on a player’s individual preferences and the environment in which they typically play.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze comes with the oblong dimple Taylor Premier grip as standard, while the Henselite Tiger EVO has an embedded Henselite Mega grip. The deeper set of the Henselite grip can make the bowl feel smaller in your hand, which is beneficial for those struggling with grip. On the other hand, the classic style of the Taylor Blaze dimple grip allows for better fingertip placement in the divots for improved grip. It's important for bowlers to consider their personal grip preferences when choosing between these two models.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of price, it is clear that the Taylor Blaze lawn bowl is slightly cheaper than the Henselite Tiger EVO. A new Taylor Blaze can be bought for £360, whereas the Henselite Tiger EVO costs around £400. Additionally, a second-hand Taylor Blaze can be found for around £210-£230, compared to a second-hand Henselite Tiger EVO which can cost between £250-£300.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it's important to note that price isn't the only factor to consider when choosing a lawn bowl. The quality, performance, and personal preference all play a role in selecting the right model. Both the Taylor Blaze and Henselite Tiger EVO are popular bowls used by experienced players, and each has its own unique features and benefits. Ultimately, the decision comes down to what works best for the individual player and their specific needs.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to choosing between the Taylor Blaze and the Henselite Tiger EVO, it's important to consider the type of surface you'll be playing on. The Taylor Blaze is a versatile option that can be used indoors or outdoors, making it ideal for players who frequently switch between different surfaces. This mid-biased bowl is sure to provide a consistent roll, no matter where you play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger EVO is specifically designed with outdoor play in mind. While it can still be used on indoor surfaces, it's biased towards open-air greens, making it an excellent choice for those who play primarily on outdoor courts. This bowl is also mid-biased, ensuring that players can enjoy a predictable roll no matter where they play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between the Taylor Blaze and the Henselite Tiger EVO will depend on the individual preferences of the player. Both models offer a mid-biased design that provides consistency and accuracy on the green, so it's just a matter of choosing the option that best suits your needs.
