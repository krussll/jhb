<!-- wp:block {"ref":2723} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a versatile and mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl suitable for outdoor play, available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. It can be used on different surfaces and conditions and is often bought new due to its rarity on online second-hand marketplaces.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC is a narrow biased lawn bowl designed for indoor play, making it a great choice for indoor bowlers or those who play on fast outdoor greens. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and can be challenging to find secondhand. Overall, the D-TEC is a reliable and high-performing lawn bowl that is worth considering for experienced players looking for a precise and accurate delivery.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of the Drakes Pride D-TEC and the Henselite Tiger EVO is that the D-TEC has a narrower bias, making it ideal for indoor rinks and faster outdoor greens, while the Tiger EVO has a mid/wide bias, making it better suited for outdoor greens and all surfaces. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2838} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The D-TEC is the narrowest biased bowl in the Drakes Pride range, while the Tiger EVO falls between the Tiger Pro and the Tiger in the Henselite range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to consider your playing environment when choosing between these two bowls. If you predominantly play indoors and on faster outdoor greens, the D-TEC would be a great match for you. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2805} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if you're playing outdoors on a variety of surfaces, the Tiger EVO would be more versatile. Ultimately, the bias of a lawn bowl can greatly impact your performance, and selecting the right one for your needs is crucial for success on the green.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO and Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowls have different types of grips. The Henselite Tiger EVO features the Heneslite Mega grip, which is embedded deeper into the bowl, resulting in a smaller feel in your hand. This can be beneficial for bowlers struggling with grip. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride D-TEC comes with a classic dimple grip along the shoulder of the bowl. The dimples give bowlers a better grip by allowing their fingertips to sit in the small divots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both grips offer their own benefits, and it comes down to personal preference. The embedded grip may be more suitable for those with gripping issues, while the dimple grip is a traditional and reliable style. Ultimately, the decision between the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Drakes Pride D-TEC will depend on individual playing style, preferences, and needs.</p>

The Henselite Tiger EVO costs around £400 when bought brand new, while the Drakes Pride D-TEC can be bought new for around £290.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
