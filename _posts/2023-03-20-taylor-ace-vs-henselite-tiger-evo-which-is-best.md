<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a bowl with a mid-to-wide bias, suitable for outdoor play. It is versatile and can be played on various surfaces and conditions. Available sizes range from 00 to 5 in the UK market. It's difficult to find second-hand options, so purchasing new is recommendable.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of the Henselite Tiger EVO lawn bowl and the Taylor Ace lawn bowl lies in their degree of bias. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2814} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace is described as a mid-biased bowl, suitable for indoor and outdoor play. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-biased/wide biased bowl, more suitable for outdoor play and all outdoor surfaces. This means that the Tiger EVO has a bigger curve compared to the Ace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite these differences, both lawn bowls have their own unique features and benefits. The Ace is a versatile bowl that can be used on various surfaces, making it a good option for both indoor and outdoor bowlers. On the other hand, the Tiger EVO is more specialized for outdoor play, with a wider bias that provides more consistency and control on outdoor greens.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Ultimately, the choice between the two depends on individual preferences and playing styles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of grip, the Taylor Ace and the Henselite Tiger EVO have distinct differences. The Taylor Ace offers a choice between the Progrip and the Taylor Xtreme grip, both of which cater to different preferences. The Progrip is a top-quality dimple grip that provides a better grip due to the small divots running along the shoulder of the bowl. On the other hand, the Xtreme grip is embedded in the bowl and provides a unique gripping surface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparison, the Henselite Tiger EVO comes with the Heneslite Mega grip as standard. This embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, which makes it feel smaller in one's hand. This grip is ideal for bowlers who struggle with holding the bowl properly. However, it lacks the classic design and versatility that the dimple grip of the Taylor Ace offers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, it comes down to personal preference whether a bowler prefers embedded or dimple grip, but the Taylor Ace has an advantage in this regard by providing both options as standard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the price of lawn bowls, the Taylor Ace and Henselite Tiger EVO are both seen as reputable options. The Taylor Ace can be bought new for £360, while the Henselite Tiger EVO costs around £400 brand new. However, when it comes to buying secondhand, the price ranges differ. The Taylor Ace can be bought secondhand for around £160-£230, while the Henselite Tiger EVO can be found for around £250-£300.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while both models offer high performance and are praised by their users, the variety in pricing for both new and secondhand options may be a deciding factor for some buyers. Those looking for a more cost-effective option may lean towards the Taylor Ace, while those with more of a flexible budget may prefer the Henselite Tiger EVO. Ultimately, the choice between the two lawn bowls comes down to the individual needs and preferences of the buyer.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to choosing between the Taylor Ace and the Henselite Tiger EVO lawn bowls, it's important to consider the type of surface you'll be playing on. The Taylor Ace is a versatile bowl that can be used both indoors and outdoors, making it a great option for those who enjoy playing in a variety of settings. Its mid-biased design means it has a good balance of stability and curve, making it easy to control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger EVO is designed specifically for outdoor play. It also has a mid-biased bias, but its shape and weight distribution are optimized for outdoor surfaces. This makes it an excellent option for those who frequently play on outdoor greens, but it can also be used on other surfaces if needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Taylor Ace and the Henselite Tiger EVO comes down to personal preference and the type of surfaces you'll be playing on most often. If you're looking for a versatile bowl that can handle a variety of environments, the Taylor Ace might be the better choice. But if you're a serious outdoor player, the Henselite Tiger EVO is definitely worth considering.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Ace and the Henselite Tiger EVO are high-quality lawn bowls that offer versatility and can be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions. While the Taylor Ace is a mid-biased bowl ideal for indoor and outdoor play, the Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-to-wide biased bowl best suited for outdoor play.
