<p>In this blog post, I'll be comparing two of the most popular models of lawn bowls - the Taylor Lignoid and the Aero GrooVe. As you read through this guide, I'll be discussing the specs of the bowls, the bias, the grip options, the price, and who the bowls would be best suited for. By the end of it, you'll have a much better idea of which bowl would be the ideal choice for you. So, let's get to it!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid is a great outdoor lawn bowl that provides a wide bias and is well-suited for skips. It's designed to work on any outdoor surface and is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only in the UK market. You can also find this model on online marketplaces like eBay, making it a popular choice among lawn bowl enthusiasts.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero GrooVe is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. It is a versatile bowl that can be used on various surfaces and conditions. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only but may be difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. It is best to purchase a new set of Aero GrooVe bowls.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid and the Aero GrooVe lawn bowls have different biases. The Lignoid is a wide biased bowl, making it suitable for outdoor greens, while the GrooVe is a mid-biased bowl, making it ideal for indoor rinks and outdoor greens. The Lignoid is the widest bowl in the Taylor range, while the GrooVe sits between the Quantum and the Sonic in the Aero range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lignoid is designed for outdoor play and should be avoided if you predominantly play indoors. On the other hand, the GrooVe is suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowlers. The Lignoid's bias is more exaggerated than the GrooVe's, giving it more stability on outdoor greens. The mid-bias of the GrooVe makes it more versatile and suitable for players who want to switch between indoor and outdoor play. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the specific needs of the player, the type of greens they play on, and their level of experience.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid comes with the Progrip which is a dimple grip and is considered one of the best. However, it does not offer the option of an embedded grip which is better for bowlers who struggle with grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the Aero GrooVe offers the most options for grip including dimple, embedded and non-gripped options. All grips come at no extra cost and are available on their entire range of bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while the Taylor Lignoid has a superior dimple grip, the lack of an embedded grip option may be a drawback for some bowlers. The Aero GrooVe's range of grip options, including the embedded grip, makes it a more flexible choice for bowlers with varying grip needs.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the price of the Taylor Lignoid and the Aero GrooVe lawn bowls, it is clear that the Aero GrooVe is more expensive. Buying the Aero GrooVe new will cost you around £400, compared to the Taylor Lignoid's price of £290. However, the Taylor Lignoid's price drops significantly when bought second-hand, with a price range of £90-130. In comparison, a second-hand set of Aero GrooVe's will still set you back a minimum of £300.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is important to note that price isn't the only factor that should be considered when choosing a set of lawn bowls. The quality, design, and performance will also play a significant role in your decision. However, if cost is a major factor for you, the Taylor Lignoid may be the better option, as it is a more affordable option both new and second-hand. Ultimately, the choice between the two brands will come down to personal preference and budget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're looking for a lawn bowl purely for outdoor play, the Taylor Lignoid is an excellent option for you. With a wide bias, the Taylor Lignoid is perfect for outdoor greens with plenty of grass to slow down the bowl. However, it's important to note that this bowl is not suited for indoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, if you want a bowl that can be used for both indoor and outdoor play, the Aero GrooVe is the perfect choice. This dual purpose bowl has the flexibility to be played in multiple positions in a team, making it a great option for any player who wants to master both indoor and outdoor games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether you're a beginner or an experienced player, your choice of lawn bowl will depend on your individual needs and preferences. So, consider whether you play mostly outdoors or indoors and whether you want a bowl that can serve both purposes. Ultimately, both the Taylor Lignoid and the Aero GrooVe are fantastic options, and with a bit of research, you'll find the perfect fit for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Lignoid and the Aero GrooVe have their own unique strengths and weaknesses. The Taylor Lignoid is well-suited for outdoor play and is a favorite among skips, while the Aero GrooVe is equally versatile for both indoor and outdoor play and can handle a variety of surface and conditions. However, the availability of the Aero GrooVe may be a challenge for those looking to buy them second-hand. Ultimately, the decision on which model to choose will depend on personal preferences and individual needs.</p>
