<p>The Taylor Ace lawn bowl is a mid-biased model perfect for both indoor and outdoor play. Versatile in its design, this bowl can effectively be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions. Available in sizes 00 to 5, this model is limited to the UK market. However, shoppers can still find the Taylor Ace on online marketplaces such as eBay.

<p>The Aero Sonic is a wide and ideal outdoor bowl with a bias designed for skips. It is available in sizes ranging from 00 to 5, but only for purchase in the UK market. While it may be difficult to find second-hand Aero Sonic bowls for purchase, they can be purchased new.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the grips of lawn bowls, the Taylor Ace and Aero Sonic both offer a range of options to suit individual bowlers. The Taylor Ace comes with a choice between the Progrip and the Taylor Xtreme grip, both of which are top-class grips. The Progrip is a dimple grip while the Xtreme grip is embedded. On the other hand, Aero Sonic offers a wider variety of grips options than other brands, including the dimple, embedded and non-gripped options, and all at no extra cost. Additionally, the embedded grip on the Aero Sonic is set deeper into the bowl, making it ideal for bowlers who have problems gripping the bowl properly.</p>

<p>Overall, both the Aero Sonic and Taylor Ace offer competitive grip options, with the Aero Sonic coming out on top for variety and inclusive pricing. Meanwhile, Taylor Ace gives an edge in terms of offering two distinct grip styles to suit various preferences. Ultimately, the choice depends on the individual bowler's preference and comfort level.</p>

Additionally, the second-hand market for the Taylor Ace ranges from £160-£230, making it a more cost-effective option for those on a budget.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if you are specifically looking for the Aero Sonic lawn bowl, it's worth noting that finding a good quality second-hand set may be difficult and could cost around £300-£360. Despite this, the Aero Sonic's unique design and impressive features may make it worth spending the additional money for those who are serious about their bowling game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
