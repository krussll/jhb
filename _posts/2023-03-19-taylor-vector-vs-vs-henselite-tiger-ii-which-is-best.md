<p>In this post, I'll be comparing two common choices - the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger II. Together, we'll take a look at the different specs, the bias, the grip options, and the price of each. By the end, you'll have a better idea of which bowl is right for you. So, let's dive in!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a narrow biased lawn bowl that is designed for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. It is more suited to indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. The Taylor Vector VS is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only and can be found on online marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<p>The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow biased lawn bowl designed for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. It is best suited for indoor bowlers and those playing lead on fast outdoor greens. Available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market only, finding them secondhand online may be challenging so purchasing them new may be necessary.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger II lawn bowls are narrow biased and suitable for indoor and fast outdoor greens. They also belong to the mid-range of their respective brands. However, there are differences in their specific features and performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to their manufacturers, the Vector VS is narrower than the Tiger II and has a more controlled bias. This makes it better suited for indoor rinks where accuracy and precision are crucial. On the other hand, the Tiger II has a slightly wider bias and is more forgiving on outdoor greens. It may also have more versatility in terms of weight options and grip patterns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these bowls would depend on the player's personal preferences and playing conditions. It's important to try them out before making a purchase and to consider factors such as grip comfort, trajectory, and consistency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to their grips, the Taylor Vector VS and Henselite Tiger II have different options for bowlers to choose from. The Taylor Vector VS comes with the Progrip, a well-regarded dimple grip. Meanwhile, the Henselite Tiger II features an embedded grip known as the Henselite Mega grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the Progrip is a high-quality option, the embedded grip on the Henselite Tiger II is deeper set into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the hand. For bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly, this could be a significant advantage. On the other hand, the dimple grip is a classic option that many bowlers have used and enjoyed over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger II will likely come down to personal preference when it comes to grips (and other factors). Both options have their strengths and weaknesses, so bowlers should take the time to try out both before making a decision.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Henselite Tiger II is generally more expensive than the Taylor Vector VS. A brand new Tiger II can cost around £420, while a new Vector VS is around £360. However, those looking for a bargain can find a used Vector VS for around £160-£190 or a used Tiger II for around £200-£290. It's important to consider the age and condition of the used bowls before making a purchase, as this can greatly impact their performance on the green.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, those looking for a more affordable option may opt for the Taylor Vector VS, while those willing to spend a bit more for cutting-edge technology may lean towards the Henselite Tiger II. Ultimately, the best option depends on personal preference and playing style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Performance</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on the descriptions of the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger II, it appears that these two lawn bowls models are quite similar. Both are narrow biased bowls and are aimed mainly at indoor bowlers, with the ability to also perform well on faster outdoor surfaces. In terms of who they would both best suit, it seems that they are both ideal for bowlers who play lead position regularly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Therefore, the choice between these two models may come down to more nuanced preferences such as grip or weight. It may also be beneficial for bowlers to try out both models before making a final decision. Overall, both the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger II are high-quality lawn bowls which are well-suited for indoor bowling and would be ideal for those who frequently play at the lead position.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger II are great lawn bowls for indoor play and fast outdoor play, with a similar narrow bias. However, the Taylor Vector VS is more readily available on second-hand marketplaces, while the Henselite Tiger II may be harder to find and require purchasing a new set. Ultimately, the choice between the two will come down to personal preference and availability in your local market.</p>
