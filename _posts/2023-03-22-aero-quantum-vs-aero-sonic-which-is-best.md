<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2709} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum is a narrow bias lawn bowl that is suitable for indoor and fast outdoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only in the UK market. The Aero Quantum is not easily found in the online second-hand marketplaces like eBay, so buying new might be the only option for getting your hands on this bowl.</p>

<p>The Aero Sonic is a wide biased lawn bowl that is perfect for outdoor play. It is suitable for all outdoor surfaces and is particularly well-suited for skips. It is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. If you are looking for a second-hand Aero Sonic, you may have trouble finding one as they are rare on online marketplaces such as eBay. It is recommended to buy the Aero Sonic new if you are interested in playing with these bowls.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum lawn bowl has a narrow bias and is suitable for both indoor and outdoor surfaces. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2826} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is the narrowest bowl in the Aero range and is ideal for bowlers who prefer narrower bowls. On the other hand, the Aero Sonic lawn bowl has a mid to wide bias and is suitable for all outdoor surfaces. It is the widest bowl in the Aero range and is ideal for bowlers who prefer wider bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of bias, the Aero Quantum is better suited for indoor bowls where precision and accuracy are essential. The narrow bias allows for more controlled and accurate shots. The Aero Sonic, on the other hand, is more suitable for outdoor bowls where the wider bias allows for more flexibility in shot selection.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, choosing between the Aero Quantum and Aero Sonic largely depends on personal preference and the specific conditions of the playing surface. Bowlers who prioritize accuracy and precision may opt for the Aero Quantum while those who value flexibility may prefer the Aero Sonic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Aero Quantum and the Aero Sonic lawn bowls offer multiple grip options, including an embedded grip and a dimple grip. These grips are available on both models, as well as on the Aero GrooVe. The embedded grip is deeper, allowing it to feel smaller in hand, which is helpful for those with grip issues. The dimple grip features small divots in the shoulder of the bowl, providing a better grip for the fingertips. Additionally, all grip options come standard and cost nothing extra, setting Aero apart from other brands.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Aero Quantum and the Aero Sonic models of lawn bowls come in at around the same price point, with both being sold new for approximately £400. However, it is worth noting that the prices for both models can vary depending on whether you are purchasing them new or second hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those on a budget, it may be worth searching for second hand sets of these bowls, which can be found for around £300-£360. Overall, if price is a deciding factor, it seems that there is not much difference between the Aero Quantum and the Aero Sonic, and shoppers should choose whichever model best fits their personal preferences and playing style rather than solely considering cost.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum and the Aero Sonic are both popular models of lawn bowls. While the Quantum is a dual purpose bowl that can be used indoors and outdoors, it is most suited for lead bowlers when played outdoors. On the other hand, the Sonic is an outdoor bowl with the flexibility to be played in multiple positions in a team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are someone who wants to play both indoors and outdoors and does not want to invest in separate bowls, then the Aero Quantum would be the ideal choice for you. However, if you are someone who mainly plays outdoors and wants a bowl that offers flexibility in terms of positions, then the Aero Sonic would be the better choice. Ultimately, the decision between the two models would depend on your personal preferences and the type of environment you play in.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, choosing between the Aero Quantum and the Aero Sonic depends on personal preference and playing conditions. The Aero Quantum is better suited for indoor play and fast outdoor greens, while the Aero Sonic is an excellent option for all outdoor surfaces and is ideal for skips. Both bowls are only available for purchase new in the UK market and are difficult to find as second-hand options. It's essential to consider your playing style and the type of green you will be playing on before making a purchase decision.</p>
