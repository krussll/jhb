<p>As we delve into the specifics like specs, bias, grip options, and price, I’ll be helping you determine which bowl will suit you best. By the end, you’ll have a much clearer understanding of which one to choose.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2709} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum is a narrow biased lawn bowl designed for speedy indoor and outdoor play. It's perfect for those who specialize in indoor bowls or frequently play on fast outdoor greens. Available in the UK market only, this model comes in a range of sizes, from 00 to 5. However, if you're looking to buy a used set, you may struggle to find any, as they tend to be sold new. Overall, the Aero Quantum is a top pick for bowlers who prioritize speed and precision.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride Professional is a mid-biased lawn bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It is a versatile bowl that can be used on different surfaces and conditions. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only in the UK market. It is also possible to find the Drakes Pride Professional on second hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between The Drakes Pride Professional and the Aero Quantum is the level of bias. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2826} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Quantum is a narrow biased bowl, while the Professional is a mid-biased bowl. This means that the Quantum will have a more pronounced hook, making it ideal for indoor rinks and outdoor greens. On the other hand, the Professional's bias is not as strong as the Quantum, which makes it suitable for indoor and outdoor bowling, but with a more controlled line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Quantum and the Professional are designed for both indoor and outdoor bowling and are ideal for different types of players. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2809} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Quantum is recommended for players who prefer a more pronounced hook and who have experience bowling on indoor or outdoor greens. The Professional, on the other hand, is recommended for players who prefer a more controlled line and are looking for a bowl that can adapt to different conditions. Ultimately, the choice between these two bowls will depend on the player's preference and playing style.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grip options, Aero Quantum offers more variety than the Drakes Pride Professional. The Aero Quantum has three grip options: dimple, embedded, and non-gripped, all of which are available on their entire range of lawn bowls. Furthermore, all of Aero's grips come as standard and do not cost anything extra.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the Drakes Pride Professional only comes with a standard dimple grip. While this classic grip style has been popular among bowlers for many years, it may not be suitable for those who have trouble gripping the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, an embedded grip, which is available with Aero Quantum lawn bowls, is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the hand. This can be an advantage for bowlers who find it difficult to grip a standard-sized bowl. Overall, both the Aero Quantum and Drakes Pride Professional have their own grip advantages, but the Aero Quantum has more options to choose from.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to pricing, the Aero Quantum is significantly more expensive compared to the Drakes Pride Professional. A brand new set of Aero Quantum lawn bowls can cost around £400, while the Drakes Pride Professional can be purchased for around £290. This means that you may have to pay up to £110 extra for the Aero Quantum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you prefer to buy second-hand, the price difference is still quite significant. The Aero Quantum second-hand price ranges from £300-£360, while the Drakes Pride Professional can be sold for as low as £60 and as high as £210. Therefore, you can potentially save a considerable amount of money by choosing the Drakes Pride Professional instead of the Aero Quantum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, while both the Aero Quantum and the Drakes Pride Professional are popular models of lawn bowls, there is a notable difference in their price range. The Aero Quantum is more expensive both new and second-hand, while the Drakes Pride Professional is more affordable, especially if you buy it second-hand. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the bowler's individual preferences and budget.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum is a great option for those who play both indoors and outdoors, and is particularly suited to lead bowlers when used outdoors. Its narrow bias allows for a variety of positions within a team indoors, giving players more flexibility on the greens.</p>
