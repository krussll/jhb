<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between The Drakes Pride Professional and the Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowls is the level of bias. The Drakes Pride Professional has a mid-bias, making it ideal for both indoor and outdoor play. On the other hand, the Taylor Legacy SL has a wide bias and is best suited for outdoor greens.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the Taylor Legacy SL is placed between the International and the Lignoid in the Taylor range, while The Drakes Pride Professional falls between the D-TEC and the XP in the Drakes Pride range. This means that the Legacy SL is slightly more biased than the Professional, making it ideal for players who require greater control and precision on outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two lawn bowls will depend on the player's preferred playing style and the types of greens they predominantly play on. The Drakes Pride Professional is a versatile bowl suitable for all types of players, while the Taylor Legacy SL is best suited for experienced players who prefer a wide bias on outdoor greens.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of the Taylor Legacy SL and the Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowls, there are some key differences to note. The Taylor Legacy SL comes with the Taylor Progrip as standard, which is a dimple grip and considered one of the best around. However, it does not come with the option of an embedded grip, which is generally considered to be better than a dimple grip.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride Professional only comes with their standard dimple grip, which is a classic style of grip. The dimples run along the shoulder of the bowl, allowing your finger tips to sit in them and giving you a better grip. However, an embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand, which can be beneficial for those who have difficulties gripping the bowl properly. Overall, it really comes down to personal preference when deciding which grip is best for you.</p>
