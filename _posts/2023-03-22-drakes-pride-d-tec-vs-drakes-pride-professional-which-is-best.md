<h2>Spec</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC is a narrow biased bowl designed for indoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or those playing on fast outdoor greens. The D-TEC is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. It may be difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces, so purchasing new may be the best option.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowl is a mid-biased, versatile bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, it can be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions. Additionally, this bowl can be found on online second hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of Drakes Pride Professional and D-TEC is that the D-TEC is a narrow-biased bowl while the Professional is a mid-biased bowl. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2805} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The D-TEC is ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens while the Professional is suitable for indoor as well as outdoor greens. The D-TEC is the narrowest biased bowl in the Drakes Pride range and should be avoided if you play predominantly outdoors in the UK.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both bowls are suitable for indoor bowlers, but the Professional is also suitable for outdoor bowlers. The D-TEC is designed for fast greens, while the Professional is suitable for a variety of greens. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2809} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The D-TEC is more specialized and ideal for specific playing conditions, while the Professional is a versatile bowl that can be used in a range of environments. Ultimately, the decision of which bowl to use will depend on personal preference and the specific conditions of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Drakes Pride D-TEC and Professional lawn bowls come with a standard dimple grip. This classic style of grip features small divots, or dimples, along the shoulder of the bowl where your fingertips can comfortably and securely rest. While the D-TEC and Professional both offer this standard dimple grip, the Professional model also offers an embedded grip option. This grip is set deeper into the bowl and can be beneficial for bowlers who struggle to maintain a proper grip on the bowl. Overall, both the D-TEC and Professional lawn bowls offer reliable and secure grips, with the added benefit of the embedded grip option for the Professional model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Drakes Pride D-TEC and the Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowls are priced similarly when bought new, at around £290. However, when it comes to buying second-hand, there is a significant difference in price between the two models. The Drakes Pride D-TEC can be bought second hand for around £120-200, while the Drakes Pride Professional can be purchased for a lower price range between £60-210.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This indicates that the Drakes Pride Professional may be a more affordable option for those on a tighter budget or looking to save money on their lawn bowls purchase. On the other hand, those willing to invest in a new model may find that the Drakes Pride D-TEC offers more advanced features and technology, making it a worthwhile investment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between the two models will depend on individual preferences and factors such as skill level, playing style, and personal budget. It is recommended to try out both models before making a purchase to determine which one works best for you.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC would be best suited for indoor bowlers who spend most of their time playing as leads. It’s narrow bias and ability to perform well on faster outdoor surfaces makes it a versatile choice for those who enjoy both indoor and outdoor bowls. However, it may not be the best choice for someone looking to play on slower outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, The Drakes Pride Professional is a great choice for anyone looking for a bowl that performs well on both indoor and outdoor surfaces.
