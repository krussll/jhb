<p>I'll be looking at everything from their specs to their price tag to help you make an informed decision. By the time we're through, you'll have a good idea of which bowl is perfect for you. So, let's get started!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2723} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a versatile lawn bowl model that features a mid-to-wide bias. This makes it an optimal choice for outdoor play and can be used on various types of surfaces and conditions. Available exclusively in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, the Henselite Tiger EVO can be hard to find on online second-hand marketplaces. It is recommended to purchase them new to ensure quality and availability.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride XP is a wide bias lawn bowl designed for outdoor play, particularly suited to skips. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and is ideal for all outdoor surfaces. While this model may be hard to find on online second-hand marketplaces, it is a reliable and durable option for those in the market for a new lawn bowl.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Drakes Pride XP and the Henselite Tiger EVO are wide biased lawn bowls that are ideal for outdoor greens and suitable for all outdoor surfaces. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Henselite Tiger EVO is a midbiased/wide biased bowl, whereas the Drakes Pride XP is the widest bowl in the Drakes Pride range. Additionally, the Henselite Tiger EVO is positioned between the Tiger Pro and the Tiger in the Henselite range, while the XP is a standalone bowl in the Drakes Pride range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2801} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while both bowls are well-suited for outdoor greens and have a wide bias, the Henselite Tiger EVO offers more versatility with its midbias option and its position within the Henselite range, while the Drakes Pride XP offers maximum width for players seeking a wider bias. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the player's individual needs and preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO comes with an embedded grip known as the Heneslite Mega grip. This design sits deeper within the bowl, making it smaller in size and better suited for bowlers who struggle with grip. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP offers a classic dimple grip, which includes small divots running along the shoulder of the bowl. This design provides a better grip as your fingertips sit in the dimples.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, both grips have their strengths and weaknesses. The Henselite Tiger EVO is perfect for those who struggle with grip, while the Drakes Pride XP offers a classic design that many bowlers prefer. It comes down to personal preference and what feels most comfortable in your hand. Regardless of which model you choose, both the Henselite Tiger EVO and Drakes Pride XP are high-quality lawn bowls that can help take your game to the next level.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A brand new set of Henselite Tiger EVO bowls costs around £400, whereas a new set of Drakes Pride XP bowls can be purchased for around £290. Additionally, if you are looking to buy second-hand, the Henselite Tiger EVO will still cost more, with prices ranging from £250 to £300 compared to £140 to £250 for the Drakes Pride XP.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Henselite Tiger EVO is a more expensive option, it's important to consider the quality and performance of the bowls.

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're an outdoor lawn bowler, both the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Drakes Pride XP are popular models to consider. The Henselite Tiger EVO, a mid-biased model, is versatile enough to be played on all surfaces. But it is ideally focused towards outdoor play, making it an excellent all-around model for bowlers who want the best of both worlds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride XP is a wide-biased model that targets outdoor lawn bowlers. It is specifically designed for outdoor play, so it may not be the best option for indoor environments. With its wider bias, the Drakes Pride XP is a model that can offer plenty of curve and predictable control, making it great for bowlers looking for reliable consistency on outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Drakes Pride XP largely boils down to what type of lawn bowling you plan on playing. Both models are known for their exceptional quality and reliable performance. If you're planning on playing mostly on outdoor surfaces, the Drakes Pride XP may be your best option. However, if you play across a range of surfaces, the Henselite Tiger EVO will likely suit your needs better.</p>
