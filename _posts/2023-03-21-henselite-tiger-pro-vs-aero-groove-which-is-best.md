<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro comes with an embedded grip known as the Henselite Mega grip. This grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand. This can be beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. However, some bowlers may find this grip too small and uncomfortable to use.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero GrooVe, on the other hand, offers a variety of grip options including an embedded grip, dimple grip, and non-gripped option. All grip types come as standard and don't cost anything extra. The dimple grip, in particular, is a classic style of grip where small divots run along the shoulder of the bowl. This provides a better grip for your fingertips as they sit in the dimples.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Henselite Tiger Pro and Aero GrooVe offer different grip options for different preferences. The Henselite Mega grip may be more suitable for those who need a smaller grip, while the Aero GrooVe's variety of grips can cater to a wider range of bowlers. It's important for individuals to try out different grips and see which one suits them best.</p>

In terms of price point, both models are targeted towards experienced bowlers who are looking for a high-quality, top-of-the-line product.
