<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum lawn bowl and Henselite Tiger EVO lawn bowl have different biases. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2838} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger EVO is midbiased/wide biased, while the Quantum is narrow biased. The Tiger EVO is suitable for all outdoor surfaces, making it ideal for outdoor greens, whereas the Quantum is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play, making it perfect for indoor rinks and outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, those who prefer a wider bias for outdoor play may prefer the Henselite Tiger EVO, while those looking for a narrow bias for both indoor and outdoor play might prefer the Aero Quantum. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2826} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two lawn bowls will depend on personal playing preferences and the specific needs of the player.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Aero Quantum, it's clear that Aero has a wider range of options. While the Henselite comes with the Mega grip as standard, which is an embedded grip that can be beneficial for those with grip issues, Aero offers a choice of dimple, embedded, and non-gripped options at no extra cost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The embedded grip on the Henselite may make the bowl feel smaller in your hand, which could be a plus for some bowlers. On the other hand, the dimple grip on the Aero is a classic design that provides small divots for your fingertips to rest in, giving you a better grip on the bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, it's a matter of personal preference which grip style you prefer, but the Aero Quantum certainly offers more options to choose from.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Aero Quantum are similar in terms of price, costing around £400 when bought brand new. However, if you're hoping to buy them second hand, you might expect to pay slightly less for the Henselite model at around £250-£300, compared to the Aero Quantum which could cost around £300-£360. Ultimately, the price difference between both models is not significant and may depend on availability and location of the seller.</p>
