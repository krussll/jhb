<p>I'll cover everything from specifications to grip options and price, so you can make an informed decision. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clear understanding of which bowl is best suited for you. Let's get started!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2703} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero GrooVe is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. With its versatility, it can be played on various surfaces and conditions. Available in sizes 00 to 5, it is exclusively marketed in the UK. While it may be challenging to find used Aero GrooVe bowls on online marketplaces like eBay, they can be purchased new from various retailers.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowl is a mid-biased bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. Its versatility makes it ideal for use on a variety of surfaces and conditions. This model is available in sizes 00 to 5 but only for the UK market. Secondhand options are available on online marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Aero GrooVe and the Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowls are mid-biased and suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2822} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The GrooVe is positioned between the Quantum and the Sonic in the Aero range, while the Professional is between the D-TEC and the XP in the Drakes Pride range. Both bowls are designed for use on a variety of surfaces, making them versatile options for players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2822} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it's worth noting that the GrooVe is specifically noted as being ideal for indoor rinks, while the Professional is described as being suited to both indoor and outdoor greens. This suggests that the GrooVe may have a bias more tailored towards indoor play. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, choosing between the two bowls may come down to personal preference and the specific conditions and style of play of the individual bowler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grip options, the Aero GrooVe has multiple features including a dimple, embedded grip, and a non-gripped option. Unlike other brands, Aero's grips are available on their entire range, including the Aero Quantum and the Aero Sonic, and come as standard with no extra cost. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride Professional only offers the standard dimple grip as its only option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The embedded grip of the Aero GrooVe is set deeper into the bowl, making it ideal for bowlers who have difficulty gripping the bowl properly. Meanwhile, the Drakes Pride Professional's classic dimple grip features small divots or dimples that run along the bowl's shoulder, providing better grip. Overall, the Aero GrooVe provides more grip options and versatility compared to the limited offering of the Drakes Pride Professional.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to lawn bowls, price can play a significant role in deciding which model to purchase. In comparing the Aero GrooVe and the Drakes Pride Professional, it's clear that the Aero GrooVe is the more expensive option. Buying a brand new set of Aero GrooVe lawn bowls can cost around £400, while finding a second-hand set will still set you back between £300 and £360.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride Professional is more affordable, with a brand new set priced at around £290. If you're willing to buy them second hand, you could save even more - with prices ranging from £60 to £210. It's also worth noting that the Drakes Pride Professional is a popular choice for both beginners and professionals alike, due to its affordability and versatility on the green.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision to choose the Aero GrooVe or the Drakes Pride Professional will come down to personal preference and budget. While the Aero GrooVe may be more expensive, some bowlers may find that their unique features and design make them worth the extra cost. However, for those looking for a reliable and cost-effective option, the Drakes Pride Professional is certainly worth considering.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
