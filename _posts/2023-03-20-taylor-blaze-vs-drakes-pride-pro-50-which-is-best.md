<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Drakes Pride PRO-50 and the Taylor Blaze are mid-biased lawn bowls that are suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. The biggest difference between the two is the subtle variation in their bias. The Taylor Blaze is a mid-biased bowl that falls between the Vector VS and Ace in the Taylor range, which makes it ideal for both indoor and outdoor use. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 is also a mid-biased bowl, but it falls between the D-TEC and XP in the Drakes Pride range and has a deeper grip, which provides more control over the ball's delivery.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Drakes Pride PRO-50 and Taylor Blaze are fantastic lawn bowls that cater to different preferences. While the Taylor Blaze is slightly more versatile, the Drakes Pride PRO-50's greater control can be beneficial in certain conditions. Ultimately, bowlers should try out both options and pick the one that feels more comfortable and suits their individual playing style.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the grips of the Taylor Blaze and the Drakes Pride PRO-50, there are some important differences to note. The Taylor Blaze comes standard with the Taylor Premier grip, which features oblong dimples rather than circular ones like the Progrip. Meanwhile, the PRO-50 offers an embedded grip option, which can be beneficial for bowlers who have trouble gripping the bowl properly. Both grips have their advantages, but it ultimately depends on personal preference and individual needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Taylor Blaze does not come with an embedded grip option, the dimple grip it does offer is one of the best around. The PRO-50's embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the hand. This can be useful for bowlers who need a tighter grip on the bowl. Ultimately, the choice between these two models comes down to which grip feels most comfortable for you and helps you perform at your best on the green.</p>
