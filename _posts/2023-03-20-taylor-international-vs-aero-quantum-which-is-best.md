There's a lot to consider, from specification to price and other features. But by the end of this guide, you'll know exactly which bowl is the perfect match for you. So, let's dive in!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum is a narrow biased lawn bowl designed for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. This model is best suited for indoor bowlers or lead players who prefer a fast pace. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, the Aero Quantum is not commonly found on online secondhand marketplaces and is best purchased new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bias of the Taylor International and the Aero Quantum lawn bowls differ significantly. The Taylor International is a midbiased/wide biased bowl and ideal for outdoor greens, whereas the Aero Quantum is a narrow biased bowl, perfect for indoor rinks and outdoor greens. The Taylor International is suitable for all outdoor surfaces, while the Aero Quantum is suitable for indoor and outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of narrowness, the Aero Quantum is the narrowest bowl in the Aero range, whereas the International is between the Ace and the Legacy in the Taylor range. While both bowls have their own strengths, the choice of which one to use would depend on factors such as the type of greens, the type of game being played, and individual preferences. Overall, it is essential to choose the right bowl to suit your playing style and the conditions you are playing in to ensure optimal performance.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparing the grips of the Aero Quantum and the Taylor International lawn bowls, there are clear differences that may appeal to different types of bowlers. The Taylor International comes with the Progrip dimple grip as standard, whereas the Aero Quantum offers a range of grip options including dimple, embedded, and non-gripped grips at no additional cost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It should be noted that an embedded grip, which sits deeper into the bowl and makes it feel smaller in your hand, may benefit bowlers who struggle with grip. Conversely, a dimple grip, which uses small divots to provide better grip, is a classic style that is included in the Taylor International as standard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice of grip will come down to personal preference and individual needs. The Aero Quantum's range of options may be a draw for those seeking more customization, while the Taylor International's Progrip may provide a reliable, tried-and-true standard for others.</p>
