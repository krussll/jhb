<p>We'll be taking a closer look at the spec of the bowls, the bias, the grip options, and the price. Plus, I'll give you my recommendation on which bowl would be the best fit for you. By the end of this guide, you'll have all the information you need to make an informed decision. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer is a narrow biased lawn bowl, designed for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or those who play as a lead on such greens. Available in sizes 00 to 5, the Taylor Lazer is only sold in the UK market. However, it can be purchased second-hand on online marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowl is a mid-biased option suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. Its versatile nature means it can be used on a range of surfaces and in varying conditions. Available in sizes 00 to 5, this model is exclusively sold in the UK. Additionally, it can be found on online marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowls have different biases. The Lazer is a narrow biased bowl that is suitable for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens but should be avoided if you play predominantly outdoors in the UK. Meanwhile, the PRO-50 is a mid-biased bowl that is ideal for both indoor rinks and outdoor greens, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the Lazer is the narrowest biased bowl in the Taylor range, while the PRO-50 has the same bias as the popular Professional bowl, with the difference being the deeper grip. The PRO-50 falls between the D-TEC and the XP in the Drakes Pride range in terms of its bias. Overall, the choice between the two bowls will depend on the individual bowler's preferences, playing style, and the environment in which they play, whether indoor or outdoor.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the grips of the Taylor Lazer and Drakes Pride PRO-50, both have their own advantages. The Taylor Lazer comes with the Taylor Progrip, a dimple grip that is highly regarded by many bowlers. However, it lacks the option of an embedded grip, which some bowlers may prefer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offers an embedded grip option, which is set deeper into the bowl and makes it feel smaller in the hand. This is beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. Despite not having the classic dimple grip, the embedded grip is preferred by many bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the two grips comes down to personal preference and what feels most comfortable for each individual bowler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Taylor Lazer and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 are relatively similar. Both can be bought new for around £290-300, but the Drakes Pride PRO-50 is slightly more expensive. However, for those who are looking to purchase these bowls second hand, the difference in price becomes more significant. The Taylor Lazer can be found for around £150-£170, while the PRO-50 can range from £190-£260.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to note that the price of lawn bowls can vary depending on the model, size, and weight. While the Taylor Lazer and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 are both considered popular models, there are other options out there that may better suit a player's needs and budget. Ultimately, it's up to the individual to decide which lawn bowl is right for them based on their skill level, playing style, and overall preferences.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on the descriptions, it can be inferred that the Taylor Lazer would best suit indoor bowlers who frequently play as a lead. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 would be more versatile and suitable for both indoor and outdoor surfaces. The PRO-50's mid-bias would make it a great option for bowlers who want a bowl that is not too narrow or wide biased. Overall, which model of lawn bowl to choose will depend on the bowler's playing style, the surface they play on, and personal preference.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After researching and comparing the Taylor Lazer and the Drakes Pride PRO-50, it is clear that both lawn bowls have their advantages and disadvantages. The Taylor Lazer is best for indoor play and those who prefer a narrow bias, while the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offers versatility with a mid-bias ideal for indoor and outdoor play on a variety of surfaces and conditions. Ultimately, the choice between the two depends on the player's personal preferences and playing style. Both lawn bowls are available in the same sizes and can be found on online marketplaces, making them accessible to players in the UK.</p>
