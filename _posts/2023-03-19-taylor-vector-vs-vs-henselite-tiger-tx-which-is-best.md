<p>In this guide, we'll be comparing factors like bowl spec, bias, grip options, price, and which bowls are best suited for different players. By the end of this post, you'll have all the information you need to make an informed decision about which bowl is the right choice for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS lawn bowl is a narrow biased model designed for indoor or fast outdoor play. It is ideal for lead bowlers or those who prefer a faster pace. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, the Taylor Vector VS can be found on second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<p>The Henselite Tiger TX is a narrow biased bowl primarily designed for indoor play. It performs best on fast outdoor greens and is recommended for players who typically play the lead position. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market only, making it a bit harder to find second hand. If you're interested in purchasing the Henselite Tiger TX, you will most likely need to buy it new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger TX and Taylor Vector VS lawn bowls are narrow biased, with the Vector VS being ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens, and the Tiger TX being most suitable for indoor play. The Vector VS sits in between the Lazer and the Blaze in the Taylor range, while the Tiger TX is the narrowest biased bowl in the Henselite range. Both bowls are suitable for indoor bowlers, but the Tiger TX should be avoided by those who predominantly play outdoors in the UK. Overall, the choice between these two bowls may come down to personal preference and the specific conditions in which they will be used.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Henselite Tiger TX has an advantage when it comes to grip thanks to its embedded Henselite Mega grip. This grip sits deeper in the bowl, making it feel smaller and easier to grip for those who struggle with larger bowls. On the other hand, the Taylor Vector VS has a classic dimple grip, which can provide a secure grip but may not be as comfortable for all bowlers. While the Taylor Progrip is an excellent dimple grip, it does not offer the option for an embedded grip. Ultimately, the best grip for you will depend on your own preferences and fit, so it's important to try out both models before making a final decision.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger TX have their differences. The Taylor Vector VS can be purchased new for £360, while the Henselite Tiger TX comes in at a higher price point of £420. However, when it comes to buying second-hand, the prices of both bowls start to even out slightly. The Taylor Vector VS can be purchased for around £160-£190, while the Henselite Tiger TX can be bought for around £260-£310.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while the prices of both lawn bowls differ slightly depending on whether they are bought new or second-hand, the Henselite Tiger TX is generally more expensive. However, it's worth bearing in mind that the price isn't necessarily the only factor to consider when choosing the right lawn bowl for you. Other factors, such as the weight and grip of the bowl, may also play a significant role in determining which model is best suited to your needs.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger TX are narrow biased lawn bowls aimed at indoor bowlers. However, the Taylor Vector VS can also be used on faster outdoor surfaces, while the Henselite Tiger TX is not recommended for outdoor use. Both bowls are ideal for players who frequently play the lead position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, if you are an indoor bowler who occasionally bowls on faster outdoor surfaces, the Taylor Vector VS may be the better option for you. On the other hand, if you strictly play indoors and lead consistently, the Henselite Tiger TX may be a better fit. Ultimately, both models are high-quality and effective lawn bowls, so the decision may come down to personal preference and individual playing style.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparing the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger TX lawn bowls, both are ideal for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. They also come in a range of sizes for the UK market. However, the main difference between them is their availability on second hand marketplaces. The Taylor Vector VS can be found on websites like eBay whereas the Henselite Tiger TX is more difficult to find and purchasing new may be necessary. Ultimately, choosing between the two will depend on personal preference and accessibility.</p>
