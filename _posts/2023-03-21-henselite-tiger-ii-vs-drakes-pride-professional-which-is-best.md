<p>The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow biased lawn bowl designed for indoor and fast outdoor play. It's best suited for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens.

It is suited to both indoor and outdoor bowlers, making it a more versatile option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II features an embedded grip, known as the Henselite Mega grip, while the Drakes Pride Professional is only offered with a classic dimple grip. The embedded grip of the Tiger II sits deeper into the bowl, which can help bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. On the other hand, the dimple grip of the Professional features small divots that allow your fingertips to sit and grip the bowl more easily.</p>

<p>Both grips have their benefits and drawbacks, and ultimately the preference of each bowler will come down to personal preference and comfort. Overall, the choice between these models ultimately depends on a bowler's individual needs and play style.</p>
