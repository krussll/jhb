<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2726} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased lawn bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. With its versatility, it is a popular choice for bowlers who play on a variety of surfaces. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, and is generally not found on online second-hand marketplaces. The Henselite Tiger Pro is quite pricey, making it one of the most expensive bowls on the market.</p>

<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play, suitable for all outdoor surfaces and best suited for skips. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only and can usually only be purchased new as it is hard to find on online second-hand marketplaces.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased bowl suitable for all bowlers, ideal for both indoor and outdoor play. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2798} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, the Henselite Tiger is a wide-biased bowl for outdoor use, making it less suitable for indoor play. The Henselite Tiger Pro is in between the Tiger and Tiger II models and is a versatile option for bowlers who play all year round. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Tiger is the widest bowl in the Henselite range and is best suited for outdoor greens specifically. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2828} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the key difference between the two lies in their bias and suitability for a particular type of playing surface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips on the Henselite Tiger and the Henselite Tiger Pro, the main difference lies in their respective grip styles. The Henselite Tiger Pro comes with the embedded Henselite Mega grip as standard, which is set deeper into the bowl and can be helpful for bowlers who struggle to grip the bowl firmly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger also has the Henselite Mega grip as standard but features a classic dimple grip style. This style has small divots along the shoulder of the bowl that enable your fingertips to sit in and provide a better grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, while both models of bowls share the same Henselite Mega grip technology, the grip style is the key difference between them. Bowlers should choose the type of grip that suits their individual needs and preferences, whether it's the deeper-set embedded grip of the Tiger Pro, or the classic dimple grip on the Tiger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Henselite Tiger and the Henselite Tiger Pro, it's clear that the Henselite Tiger Pro is the more expensive option. A brand new set of the Tiger Pro can cost around £400, while a used set typically sells for between £250 and £300. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger costs the same as the Tiger Pro when bought new, but second-hand sets of this model can be found for significantly less, between £200 and £690 for the Tiger II.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's worth keeping in mind that the price difference between these two models isn't simply a matter of one being better than the other. The Henselite Tiger Pro is designed for competitive players and has features that make it more consistent and precise. This includes a narrower profile, a wider draw line, and a denser core. The Henselite Tiger, while still a high-quality lawn bowl, doesn't have these specialized features and is intended for a wider range of players, from beginners to experienced bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, when choosing between the Henselite Tiger and the Henselite Tiger Pro, the decision will come down to the player's skill level and budget. While the Henselite Tiger Pro may offer greater precision, it may not be necessary for every player. And while the Henselite Tiger may lack some of the specialized features of the Pro, it is still a quality and reliable lawn bowl that can serve many players well.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are a player who enjoys both indoor and outdoor games, you may want to consider the Henselite Tiger Pro. With its versatile design, this dual purpose bowl will allow you to perform at your best in any setting, and can be used in multiple positions within a team. On the other hand, if you only play outdoors, then the Henselite Tiger is the bowl to choose. This wide biased bowl is specifically designed for outdoor games and should be avoided for indoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, the Henselite Tiger Pro and Henselite Tiger are both popular models of lawn bowls, but are suited for different types of players. If you want versatility in your gameplay and enjoy playing both indoors and outdoors, then the Henselite Tiger Pro is the bowl for you. However, if you are an outdoor player only, then the Henselite Tiger is a great option to improve your performance on the green.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Henselite Tiger Pro and Henselite Tiger bowls have their own unique benefits and drawbacks. The Tiger Pro is more versatile and suitable for a wider range of surfaces, while the Tiger is specifically designed for outdoor play and is ideal for skips. Both models are only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and are difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces. However, it is important to note that the Tiger Pro is significantly more expensive than the Tiger. Ultimately, choosing between these bowls will depend on individual preferences and playing style.</p>
