<p>Today, we'll be comparing two popular models - the Henselite Tiger TX and the Henselite Tiger Pro. I will be discussing the spec of the bowls, the bias, the grip options, the price, and who the bowls will be best for. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clearer picture of which bowl is the right fit for you. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2732} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX is a narrow biased lawn bowl designed for indoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or those playing lead on fast outdoor greens. The bowl comes in sizes 00 to 5 and is only available in the UK market. It may be challenging to find the Henselite Tiger TX on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay, as they are typically only sold new.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro is a high-end lawn bowl model designed for both indoor and outdoor play. It has a mid-biased bias which makes it suitable for different surfaces, making it a great choice for bowlers who frequently switch between indoor and outdoor bowling. It is only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and can be challenging to find in online second-hand marketplaces due to its popularity and price. The Henselite Tiger Pro is a premium bowl model, and therefore comes at a high price.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Henselite Tiger TX is their width. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2835} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger TX is the narrowest biased bowl in the Henselite range, making it more suitable for indoor rinks but less effective for outdoor play, especially in the UK. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the Tiger Pro has a mid-bias that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor greens, making it a more versatile option for all-round play. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2798} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger Pro is ideal for those who play all year round, whereas the Tiger TX is more suited to indoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger TX and the Henselite Tiger Pro models come with the same Henselite Mega grip, which is an embedded grip. This means that the grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand. This is an advantage for bowlers who have difficulties gripping the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Henselite Mega grip is the same for both models, the Tiger Pro also offers a dimple grip. This traditional style grip features small divots, or dimples, along the shoulder of the bowl which allows your fingertips to sit in them for better grip. This may appeal to bowlers who prefer a more classic style grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both models offer the same embedded Henselite Mega grip, with the addition of a dimple grip on the Tiger Pro. The choice between the two may come down to personal preference and the style of grip that feels most comfortable for each individual bowler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price comparisons between the Henselite Tiger TX and the Henselite Tiger Pro, the differences are minimal. The Tiger TX can be bought new for roughly £420, while the Tiger Pro costs around £400 brand new. However, when it comes to finding second-hand bowls, the Tiger TX tends to be slightly more expensive, coming in at around £260-310, compared to the Tiger Pro's £250-300 price range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, when choosing between the two models, price shouldn't be the deciding factor. Both the Tiger TX and the Tiger Pro have unique features and benefits that will appeal to different types of bowlers. It's important to consider factors such as grip, bias, and weight distribution when making a decision, and to try out both models if possible to see which one feels best for your specific needs and playing style.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are an indoor bowler who frequently plays as a lead, the Henselite Tiger TX would be an excellent choice for you. Its narrow bias is specifically designed for indoor use, and it excels in positions where accuracy is crucial.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger Pro is a versatile option that can be used both indoors and outdoors. Its dual-purpose design makes it ideal for those who want to play in a variety of settings. Additionally, its flexibility allows it to be utilized in multiple positions within a team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between the Henselite Tiger TX and the Henselite Tiger Pro will depend on your specific needs as a bowler. Consider what type of gameplay you participate in and what positions you typically play, and choose the bowl that best suits your playing style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Henselite Tiger TX are both high-quality lawn bowls that offer different advantages. While the Tiger TX is ideal for indoor play and has a narrow bias, the Tiger Pro is a mid-biased bowl that can be used both indoors and outdoors. The Tiger Pro may be more versatile but also has a higher price point. Ultimately, bowlers should choose the bowl that best fits their playing style and needs. However, one thing to note is that both bowls can be difficult to find secondhand and may require purchasing new.</p>
