<p>That's why I'm here to walk you through a comparison of two popular models - the Taylor International and the Drakes Pride Professional. In this post, I'll be breaking down the specs, bias, grip options, pricing, and who each bowl is best for. By the time we're done, you'll have a clear idea of which lawn bowl will be the perfect fit for you. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International is a mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl that is perfect for outdoor play. It is a versatile bowl that can handle a variety of surfaces and conditions, making it an ideal choice for bowlers of all skill levels. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5 but is only sold in the UK market. If you're looking to purchase the Taylor International, you can find it both new and used on online marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride Professional is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. This versatile bowl is capable of adapting to a variety of different surfaces and conditions. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, these bowls can be easily found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Drakes Pride Professional and the Taylor International lawn bowls are mid-biased, meaning they have a moderate curve when rolled. However, the International is also considered wide-biased, meaning it has a more pronounced curve than the Professional. The International is best suited for outdoor greens and is suitable for all outdoor surfaces, while the Professional is ideal for both indoor rinks and outdoor greens, making it a versatile option for both indoor and outdoor bowlers.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another difference between the two bowls is their placement within their respective brand ranges. The International is positioned between the Ace and the Legacy in the Taylor range, while the Professional falls between the D-TEC and the XP in the Drakes Pride range. These slight variations in bias and positioning within the brand product lines allow bowlers to select a bowl that best fits their individual needs and preferences.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the grips of the Taylor International and the Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowls, there are a few key differences to note. The Taylor International comes with the Taylor Progrip as standard, which is a highly regarded dimple grip. While it doesn't offer the option of an embedded grip, many bowlers find the Progrip to be one of the best around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride Professional only comes with their standard dimple grip. While this classic style of grip is popular among bowlers, it may not be as suitable for those who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, which can make it feel smaller in your hand and therefore easier to handle for some bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Taylor International and the Drakes Pride Professional may come down to personal preference when it comes to grip style. However, those who prioritize an embedded grip may find that the Taylor International doesn't meet their needs.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the price of the Taylor International and the Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowls, it is clear that the Taylor International is on the higher end of the scale. A new set of Taylor Internationals can cost as much as £360, whereas a new set of Drakes Pride Professionals can be purchased for around £290. However, there is a significant price gap when it comes to purchasing second-hand. The Taylor International can be bought for roughly £100-£190, while the Drakes Pride Professional can be bought for as little as £60, but can also cost up to £210.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is important to note that the price of lawn bowls can vary depending on factors such as the level of expertise of the player and the condition of the bowls. While the Taylor International may be more expensive, some players may find that its performance and durability make it worth the investment. Meanwhile, the Drakes Pride Professional may be a more affordable option that still provides a high level of quality. Ultimately, the decision of which lawn bowl to purchase should be based on individual preferences and needs.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor International and the Drakes Pride Professional are mid-biased lawn bowls suitable for a range of surfaces. However, there are some key differences between the two which may make one more suitable for certain players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International is marketed towards outdoor players and has a slightly narrower bias than the Drakes Pride Professional. This means it is likely to be slightly more accurate on outdoor surfaces, particularly when playing longer lengths. However, it can still be used indoors if necessary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conversely, the Drakes Pride Professional is aimed at both indoor and outdoor players, and has a slightly wider bias than the Taylor International. It may be slightly more forgiving on indoor surfaces where accuracy is key, particularly when playing shorter lengths.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two bowls will depend on individual preference and playing style. Players who primarily play outdoors and prefer a narrower bias may opt for the Taylor International, while those who play on a variety of surfaces or favor indoor play may prefer the Drakes Pride Professional.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor International and the Drakes Pride Professional are excellent lawn bowls with unique features. While the Taylor International is mid-to-wide biased and ideal for outdoor play, the Drakes Pride Professional is mid-biased and suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. Both bowls are versatile and can be used on various surfaces and conditions. Both of them are available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only and can be found on online second hand marketplaces such as eBay. In conclusion, either of these bowls would be a great investment for any lawn bowler looking for high-quality gear.</p>
