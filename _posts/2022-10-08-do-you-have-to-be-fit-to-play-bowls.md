<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So just how fit do you have to be to play? Is there a base fitness you need to play, and enjoy the game? Lets have a closer look.</p>

<h2>Do you have to be fit to play bowls?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>No, you do not have to be fit to play bowls. Even older bowlers with mobility issues can still play with adjusted techniques, support, and aids.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the average person you can start playing straight away without any special training. You may find your legs are a bit sore after the first few games, but your body will soon get used to it!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those who feel they may need some support, either because of old age, or from having something like <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/can-you-play-bowls-with-arthritis/" data-type="post" data-id="1447">arthritis</a> there are many <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/guide/lawn-bowls-bowling-aids/" data-type="post" data-id="770">aids</a> to help you.</p>

<h2>Does fitness help when playing bowls</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to be competitive in bowls at county, national or international level then being fit will help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowls is a game of repetition, and your bowling stride should be as balanced and controlled from the first shot through to the last - especially if you have to play multiple games in a day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having some decent lower body and core endurance will be important.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if you just play at club level, or for the social side of the game, then there is no need to be concerned with your fitness levels.</p>

<h2>How to get fit for playing bowls</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are plenty of exercises you can do to get fit for playing bowls, however, the best way is to simply play a lot of bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By playing a lot you are getting your body used to the movements required to compete. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowls is also a game played over a long period of time - often several hours. It is extremely difficult to recreate that off the green.</p>
