<p>I'll walk you through the specs, the bias, the grip options, the price, and most importantly, which one will be the best fit for YOU. So, sit back, relax, and read on to have a crystal-clear understanding of which lawn bowl is ideal for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer is a narrow bias lawn bowl that is perfect for indoor play. It is also suitable for players who play lead on fast outdoor greens. The bowl is available in sizes ranging from 00 to 5 for the UK market only and can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. It is suitable for all outdoor surfaces and is particularly well-suited for players in the skip position. The Tiger is available in sizes 00 through 5, but it is important to note that it is only available in the UK market. Additionally, it may be difficult to find the Henselite Tiger on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay, so it may be necessary to purchase them new.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of the Henselite Tiger and the Taylor Lazer lawn bowls is that the Tiger has a wider bias while the Lazer has a narrow bias. The Tiger is ideal for outdoor surfaces while the Lazer is more suited for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger and the Lazer also have different ideal user groups. The Tiger is suitable for all outdoor bowlers while the Lazer should be avoided by those who play predominantly outdoors in the UK. On the other hand, the Lazer is suitable for indoor bowlers while the Tiger may not be as effective on indoor rinks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between the Henselite Tiger and the Taylor Lazer lawn bowls will largely depend on the playing surface and the user's preferred environment. It's important to understand these differences to choose the right lawn bowl for optimal performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of the Henselite Tiger and the Taylor Lazer, one key difference is that the Tiger comes with an embedded grip, while the Lazer only offers a dimple grip. An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, which can make it feel smaller in your hand, and is often preferred by those who have difficulty gripping the bowl effectively. On the other hand, the dimple grip is a classic style where small divots are placed along the bowl's shoulder. This is designed to provide a better grip by allowing your fingertips to sit in the dimples.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Taylor Lazer does not come with the option of an embedded grip, it features the Taylor Progrip, which is widely regarded as one of the best dimple grips available. However, some bowlers may still prefer an embedded grip for the extra security it provides. Ultimately, the choice between the two grip styles will come down to personal preference, as both types provide their own unique advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, there is a clear difference between the Taylor Lazer and the Henselite Tiger. The Taylor Lazer is a more affordable option, with a new set costing around £290 and a second-hand set costing between £150-£170. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger is pricier, with a brand new set costing around £400 and the Tiger II version being sold second-hand for between £200-£690.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Taylor Lazer may be more budget-friendly, it's important to note that the price isn't the only factor to consider when choosing a lawn bowl model. The Henselite Tiger is known for its excellent grip, which could make it the better choice for players who prioritize control and accuracy. Meanwhile, the Taylor Lazer is reputable for its stability and predictable trajectory, making it a comfortable option for players looking for a reliable set of bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the decision between the Taylor Lazer and the Henselite Tiger will depend on various factors such as budget, playing style, and personal preference. It's advisable to try out both models before making a final decision on which one to purchase.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer and the Henselite Tiger are two popular models of lawn bowls that appeal to different types of bowlers. The Taylor Lazer is narrower and biased towards indoor play, making it a good choice for lead bowlers who predominantly play indoors. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger is wider and suited for outdoor play, making it a better option for bowlers who play exclusively outdoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to consider where you'll be playing most frequently when choosing between these two models. If you primarily play indoors, the Taylor Lazer's narrow bias will help you navigate the tighter space. Conversely, if you play outdoors often, the Henselite Tiger's wider bias will allow for better stability on uneven terrain. Ultimately, both the Taylor Lazer and the Henselite Tiger are high-quality lawn bowls, but choosing the right one comes down to your playing style and preferences.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, the choice between the Henselite Tiger and the Taylor Lazer lawn bowls will largely depend on the player's preferred playing surface and position on the team. The Taylor Lazer is best suited for indoor play and players who play lead on fast outdoor greens, while the Henselite Tiger is ideal for all outdoor surfaces and is suited to skips. Additionally, while both bowls are available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, the Henselite Tiger may be harder to find on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay, making purchasing new bowls a more realistic option. Ultimately, it is important for players to consider their individual preferences and needs when choosing between these popular models.</p>
