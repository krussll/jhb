<p>We'll go through the specifications of each bowl, their bias, the grip options, and the price. By the end of this guide, you'll have a better idea of which bowl will suit you best. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2711} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL is a wide biased lawn bowl that is perfect for outdoor play. It features a bias that is well suited for all outdoor surfaces, making it an ideal choice for skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5 exclusively for the UK market, the Taylor Legacy SL is a popular choice among lawn bowlers. Additionally, those looking for a good deal may be able to find the Taylor Legacy SL on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride XP is a highly suitable lawn bowl for outdoor play, with a wide bias that works well on a variety of surfaces. This model is particularly suitable for skips, comes in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market, and is primarily sold new rather than second-hand. Therefore, if you're looking for a reliable and high-performing lawn bowl designed for outdoor play, the Drakes Pride XP is definitely worth considering.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Drakes Pride XP and the Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowls are wide-biased and designed for outdoor play. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2811} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Legacy SL is between the International and the Lignoid in Taylor's range, the XP is the widest bowl in Drakes Pride's range. Both bowls are ideal for outdoor greens, and should be avoided if you play mainly indoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having said that, the XP is not so wide that is unplayable indoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2801} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both bowls have their own unique features and specifications, but the bias and suitability for outdoor greens are similar. It ultimately depends on personal preference and playing style when choosing between the two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the grips of the Taylor Legacy SL and the Drakes Pride XP is that the Taylor Legacy SL comes with the Taylor Progrip, a dimple grip that is considered one of the best around. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP only offers a standard dimple grip. Additionally, the Taylor Legacy SL does not come with the option of an embedded grip, which is set deeper into the bowl and can make it feel smaller in your hand. This can be beneficial for bowlers who have trouble with grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while both models have a classic dimple grip, the Taylor Legacy SL has a more advanced gripping system with the Progrip. However, the Drakes Pride XP does offer an embedded grip option for those who need it. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on a bowler's personal grip preferences and needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the price of the Taylor Legacy SL and the Drakes Pride XP lawn bowls, it is evident that both models are priced similarly when bought new at around £290. However, the price difference becomes more noticeable when looking at the second-hand market. The Taylor Legacy SL can be purchased second-hand for a significantly lower price of around £100-£160, whereas the Drakes Pride XP second-hand market price ranges from £140-£250.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Taylor Legacy SL appears to be the more budget-friendly option for those who are looking to purchase a high-quality lawn bowl without breaking the bank. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is still a solid contender for those willing to spend a little extra for a more luxurious option. Regardless of which model is chosen, both lawn bowls offer exceptional performance and are popular choices among the lawn bowls community.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Legacy SL and the Drakes Pride XP lawn bowls are designed for outdoor use and feature a wide biased shape. However, the Taylor Legacy SL is specifically aimed at players who only play outdoors, while the Drakes Pride XP is marketed as a versatile bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you primarily play outdoors and are looking for a high-performing lawn bowl, the Taylor Legacy SL may be the best choice for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for a bowl that can be used in a variety of settings, including indoors, the Drakes Pride XP may be a great option. Ultimately, the best lawn bowl for you will depend on your individual preferences and playing style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Legacy SL and the Drakes Pride XP are great options for those looking for a wide biased outdoor lawn bowl suitable for skips. However, the main difference between the two is their availability. While the Taylor Legacy SL can be found on second-hand marketplaces such as eBay, the Drakes Pride XP is harder to come by and realistically must be purchased new. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the individual's preferences and budget.</p>
