<h2>Spec</h2>

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2719} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play on all surfaces, especially suited to skips. Its sizes range from 00 to 5 and are only available in the UK market. These bowls can be challenging to find on online second-hand marketplaces, making buying new the most practical option.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride Professional is a versatile lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It has a mid-biased bias and comes in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. This bowl is an excellent choice for players looking for a bowl that can be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions. Additionally, the Drakes Pride Professional is available on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bias of the Henselite Tiger lawn bowl is significantly wider than that of the Drakes Pride Professional. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2828} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger is designed specifically for outdoor greens and is not recommended for indoor surfaces. In comparison, the Drakes Pride Professional is suitable for both indoor and outdoor use, making it a more versatile option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Henselite Tiger is ideal for outdoor bowlers who play exclusively on outdoor greens, while the Drakes Pride Professional provides a mid-bias option for bowlers who play on both indoor and outdoor surfaces. </p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger and Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowls differ in their grip design. The Henselite Tiger features the embedded Henselite Mega grip, while the Drakes Pride Professional uses a classic dimple grip. The embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the hand, which is ideal for bowlers who struggle with grip. Conversely, the dimple grip features small divots along the shoulder of the bowl, creating a better grip for the fingertips. Ultimately, the choice between the two grips will depend on the bowler's personal preference and individual needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Henselite Tiger is more expensive than the Drakes Pride Professional. A brand new Henselite Tiger can cost around £400, while a new Drakes Pride Professional can be bought for around £290. However, if you're looking for a more affordable option, the Drakes Pride Professional can be bought second-hand for as little as £60, compared to the Henselite Tiger II which can be bought for a price range of £200-690.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the price comparison between the two models comes down to personal budget and preference. While the Henselite Tiger may come with a higher price tag, it is important to consider its longevity and performance on the green. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride Professional is a more budget-friendly option and can still perform well for those looking for a less expensive set of bowls.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger and the Drakes Pride Professional are both popular models of lawn bowls. The Henselite Tiger is best suited for players who prefer to play solely outdoors, as it has a wide bias which makes it less suitable for indoor surfaces. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride Professional is versatile and can be used both indoors and outdoors due to its mid-bias design.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are an outdoor lawn bowler who enjoys playing in varying weather and green conditions, the Henselite Tiger would be a great choice. However, indoor lawn bowlers looking for a bowl that offers accuracy and control on a fast indoor green would be better off opting for the Drakes Pride Professional. Ultimately, it all comes down to personal preference and the specific playing conditions you encounter.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After comparing the Henselite Tiger and the Drakes Pride Professional bowls, it is clear that both models have their pros and cons. The Henselite Tiger is ideal for outdoor play and is best suited for skips, but it is hard to find second hand and only available in the UK market. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride Professional is a versatile bowl that can be used for indoor and outdoor play on a variety of surfaces and conditions. It is also easier to find on second hand marketplaces. Ultimately, the choice between these two models will depend on individual preferences and needs.</p>
