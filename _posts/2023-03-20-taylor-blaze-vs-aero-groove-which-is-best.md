<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>The Aero GrooVe is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. Its versatility allows it to perform well on different surfaces and under varied conditions. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, it is a popular choice for lawn bowlers. However, due to its high demand and limited availability, it is challenging to find it on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay. Therefore, buying it new might be the best option. Overall, the Aero GrooVe is a reliable, all-around lawn bowl that can help players improve their game.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Aero GrooVe and Taylor Blaze lawn bowls are mid-biased and ideal for both indoor and outdoor play. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2819} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blaze is between the Vector VS and the Ace in Taylor's range, while the GrooVe is between the Quantum and the Sonic in the Aero range. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both have slightly different bias and weight distribution, they are suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The biases are very similar on both the Taylor Blaze and the Aero GrooVe, so there is very little to split them here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2822} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, it would be best to try both and determine which bowl works best for each individual's needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grip options, the Aero GrooVe seems to dominate. With choices like embedded, dimple, and non-gripped, Aero offers more flexibility. On the other hand, the Taylor Blaze only comes with the standard Premier grip or optional Progrip, which are both dimple grips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Embedded grips are deeper set, making the bowl feel smaller in your hand. They can be beneficial for individuals who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. Dimple grips, on the other hand, are more classic in style and feature small divots along the shoulder of the bowl. This design allows your fingers to sit in the dimples for better grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, if you're looking for more options in grip style, the Aero GrooVe is the clear winner. However, if you prefer the traditional style of a dimple grip, the Taylor Blaze may be the choice for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Taylor Blaze and the Aero GrooVe, the Taylor Blaze is a more affordable option. A new set of Taylor Blaze bowls costs around £360, while a second-hand set can be purchased for around £210-£230. On the other hand, the Aero GrooVe is a more expensive option, with a new set costing around £400, and a second-hand set costing between £300-£360.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's worth noting, however, that both the Taylor Blaze and the Aero GrooVe are high-quality lawn bowls that are designed to perform well on the green. While the Taylor Blaze may be a more affordable option, the Aero GrooVe has a reputation for delivering exceptional accuracy and control. Ultimately, the decision between these two popular options will depend on your personal preferences and budget.</p>

This makes it a great option for players who are looking for versatility and want a bowl that can be used in different environments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>On the other hand, the Aero GrooVe is a fantastic dual purpose bowl that is suitable for anyone who wants to play both indoors and outdoors.
