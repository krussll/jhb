<p>I'll be comparing their specs, biases, grip options, prices, and who they're best suited for. By the end of this guide, you'll have a much better idea of which bowl is the perfect match for you. Let's dive in!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2695} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer is a lawn bowl model that features a narrow bias, making it an ideal choice for indoor play or for use on fast outdoor greens. It is available in UK sizes 00 to 5 and is most suited for indoor bowlers or those playing lead position. This model can also be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a narrow biased lawn bowl suitable for indoor and fast outdoor play. This model is best suited for indoor bowlers and those who play lead on quick outdoor greens. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, the Taylor Vector VS can also be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. Overall, the Taylor Vector VS is a great choice for bowlers looking for a precise and accurate delivery on quick greens.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Vector VS and the Lazer are narrow biased lawn bowls that are ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2816} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Lazer is the narrowest biased bowl in the Taylor range and is best suited for indoor bowlers, while the Vector VS is slightly wider and suitable for both indoor and lead outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2803} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the bias of these bowls depends on the player's preferences, playing style, and the type of greens they play on. It is important to try out different bowls before purchasing to ensure the best fit for your game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lazer and Taylor Vector VS come with the Taylor Progrip as standard, which is a dimple grip and considered one of the best grips around. However, neither of these bowls come with the option of an embedded grip, which is often preferred by bowlers who have difficulty gripping the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the hand and providing increased control. In comparison, the dimples of a classic style grip like the Progrip on the Taylor Lazer and Vector VS provide better grip by allowing the fingertips to sit in the divots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while the Taylor Progrips on both the Lazer and Vector VS are high-quality, bowlers may prefer an embedded grip over a dimple grip depending on their individual gripping needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the price comparison of the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Vector VS, it's clear that the Lazer is more affordable. A new Lazer can be purchased for £290, while the Vector VS comes in at a higher price point of £360.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it's important to note that second-hand prices for these bowls vary widely. While a second-hand Lazer can be found for around £150-£170, a second-hand Vector VS goes for a similar price range of £160-£190. This suggests that while the Vector VS is more expensive to purchase new, it might hold its value better over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between the two models will depend on individual preferences and priorities, both in terms of price and other factors like weight and size. But for those looking for a more affordable option, the Taylor Lazer could be a good bet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Vector VS are narrow biased bowls that are designed for indoor play. They both work well for lead players, but the difference lies in their suitability for outdoor play. The Taylor Lazer is not recommended for outdoor use, whereas the Taylor Vector VS can be played on faster outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, if you are an indoor bowler who plays lead position and never plays outdoors, the Taylor Lazer could be the perfect choice for you. On the other hand, if you play both indoors and outdoors or prefer a bowl that can be used on any surface, the Taylor Vector VS would be a better option. Ultimately, it depends on your individual preferences and playing style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After comparing the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Vector VS, it is evident that both models are well-suited for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. However, the Taylor Vector VS also offers versatility for outdoor play, making it a better choice for players who want a bowl that can perform well in both environments. Additionally, the Taylor Vector VS is available in the same sizes as the Taylor Lazer and can also be found on online second-hand marketplaces. Overall, while the Taylor Lazer may be a good option for indoor play, the Taylor Vector VS offers more versatility and adaptability, making it the better choice for players looking for a well-rounded lawn bowl.</p>
