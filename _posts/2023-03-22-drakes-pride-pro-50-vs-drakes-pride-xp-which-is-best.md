<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The PRO-50 has a mid-bias which makes it ideal for indoor and outdoor greens. It has the same bias as the popular Professional bowl, but with deeper grips. The XP, on the other hand, has a wide bias, making it the widest bowl in the Drakes Pride range. It is perfect for outdoor greens and all outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The PRO-50 and the XP are both versatile and suitable for players at different levels. The mid-bias of the PRO-50 makes it an excellent choice for players transitioning from indoor to outdoor bowling. Its deeper grips provide extra control, making it easier for players to achieve their desired shots. The XP's wide bias, meanwhile, makes it ideal for players who want to take advantage of the natural curves of outdoor greens. Its wider radius provides a smooth, consistent line that can help players achieve accuracy and precision.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're in the market for a new lawn bowl and considering Drakes Pride, you're probably wondering what the difference is between the PRO-50 and XP grips. The main difference is that the PRO-50 has an embedded grip option while the XP only comes with the standard dimple grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The embedded grip on the PRO-50 means that the grip is set deeper into the bowl, making the bowl feel smaller in your hand. This can be beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. On the other hand, the dimple grip on the XP is a classic style that features small divots along the shoulder of the bowl. The intention is for your fingertips to rest in these dimples, which should help improve your grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the best grip for you may come down to personal preference and what feels most comfortable in your hand. If you have concerns about grip, it may be worth trying out bowls with different grip options before making your final decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Drakes Pride PRO-50 and the XP, it's clear that the PRO-50 is more expensive when bought brand new, with a price tag of around £300. However, it's worth noting that the PRO-50 can be purchased second-hand for around £190-260, making it a more affordable option for those who aren't looking to spend a lot on lawn bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is priced at around £290 when bought new, which is slightly cheaper than the PRO-50. Additionally, the XP can be purchased second-hand for around £140-250, making it a more wallet-friendly choice for those who are just starting out in the world of lawn bowls or who don't want to spend a lot of money on their equipment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the two models will come down to personal preference and budget. While the PRO-50 may be the more expensive option, it's worth considering purchasing it second-hand to save some money. Meanwhile, the XP is a great choice for those who want a quality lawn bowl without breaking the bank.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're looking for a lawn bowl that can be used both indoors and outdoors, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 may be the best option for you. As a mid-biased biased bowl, it's designed to provide a moderate amount of curve, giving you versatility on a variety of surfaces. Additionally, its construction is ideal for both indoor and outdoor use, so you won't have to worry about changing your equipment between seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, if you play primarily outside and require a bowl with greater bias, the Drakes Pride XP may be a better choice. With a wide bias and specific design for outdoor play, it makes a powerful addition to any player's arsenal. However, due to its bias, it is not recommended for indoor use. If you play exclusively outdoors or are looking to upgrade your outdoor setup, the Drakes Pride XP is definitely worth considering.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Drakes Pride PRO-50 and the Drakes Pride XP have their strengths and are popular choices among lawn bowls enthusiasts. However, the PRO-50 is more versatile, suitable for both indoor and outdoor play, and can be found on online second hand marketplaces. The XP, on the other hand, is a wide biased bowl that excels in outdoor play and is suitable for skips, but can be harder to find on the second hand market. Ultimately, the choice between these two models will depend on each individual's specific needs and preferences on the green.</p>
