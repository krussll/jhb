<p>We'll explore key factors such as the spec, bias, grip options, price, and which bowlers would benefit most from each model. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clear picture of which bowl is right for you. Let's get started!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. This versatile bowl is designed to perform well on a variety of surfaces and under various conditions. The Taylor Blaze comes in sizes 00 to 5, but it is only available in the UK market. You can also find it in second-hand online marketplaces like eBay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. It's ideal for all types of outdoor surfaces and is particularly suited to skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, the Henselite Tiger is not commonly available on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay. Therefore, if you're interested in this model, it's best to purchase it new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference in the bias of The Henselite Tiger and the Taylor Blaze lawn bowls is that the Tiger is wide biased while the Blaze is mid-biased. This means that the Tiger has a greater turn when it comes to the bowl's direction, making it more suitable for outdoor greens. On the other hand, the Blaze has a more subtle turn, making it ideal for both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of suitability, the Blaze is a versatile bowl that can be used in both indoor and outdoor play. It caters to both indoor and outdoor bowlers and is a suitable option for medium-paced greens. The Tiger, on the other hand, is more specialized for outdoor greens and should mainly be used in this setting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Henselite Tiger and the Taylor Blaze have different biases that cater to different preferences and environments. The Blaze is more versatile, while the Tiger is more specialized, making it important to choose the right bowl based on your specific needs.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze and the Henselite Tiger are two popular models of lawn bowls. One key difference between these two models is the type of grip that they offer. The Taylor Blaze comes with the Taylor Premier grip, which is a dimple grip. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger comes with the Henselite Mega grip, which is an embedded grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While a dimple grip like the one on the Taylor Blaze is considered a classic style of grip that provides a better grip, some bowlers may find the embedded grip on the Henselite Tiger more comfortable. This is because an embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the hand, which can be an advantage for those who struggle to grip the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice of grip between the Taylor Blaze and the Henselite Tiger will ultimately come down to personal preference and individual needs. Both grips have their advantages and disadvantages, and bowlers should consider their own hand size, grip strength, and other factors before making a decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the prices of two of the most popular models of lawn bowls, the Taylor Blaze and the Henselite Tiger, the differences are not particularly significant. A new Taylor Blaze can be purchased for £360, while a new Henselite Tiger costs around £400. However, if you're looking to buy a second-hand set, the prices for both models become more appealing. The Taylor Blaze can be found for around £210-£230, while a second-hand Henselite Tiger can cost anywhere between £200-£690.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Henselite Tiger is slightly more expensive than the Taylor Blaze, but its second-hand price range is wider. Ultimately, the decision on which model to go for will depend on your personal preferences and budget. Both sets have been praised for their high-quality materials and construction, comfortable grip, and excellent performance on the green. Whether you choose the Taylor Blaze or the Henselite Tiger, you can be sure that you're investing in a top-quality lawn bowls set that will serve you well for many years to come.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to lawn bowls, choosing the right one can make all the difference in your game. The Taylor Blaze and Henselite Tiger are two popular models, but they are suited for different players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those who frequently play on both indoor and outdoor surfaces will benefit from the mid-biased Taylor Blaze. Its versatility means it can function well on both fast and slow-paced greens, making it a great option for players with varied terrain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alternatively, the wide-biased Henselite Tiger is an excellent choice for outdoor players who prefer a bowl that can handle varying wind conditions. Designed to grip the grass firmly, it is ideal for outdoor turf and can offer an edge for more experienced players. However, it is not recommended for indoor play, as its bias can make it difficult to control on smooth surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In essence, the Taylor Blaze is a versatile bowl best suited for those who regularly play on mixed surfaces. Meanwhile, the Henselite Tiger is perfect for outdoor play but not recommended for indoors.
