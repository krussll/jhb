<p>In this blog post, I will be comparing two popular lawn bowl models - the Taylor Lazer and the Henselite Tiger Pro. Together, we will examine the spec of the bowls, their bias, grip options, price, and who might benefit most from each type. By the time we're done, you'll have all the information you need to confidently select the perfect lawn bowl for you!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer is a narrow, indoor-focused lawn bowl with a bias designed for use on fast outdoor greens. Available in sizes 00 to 5 (for the UK market only), it's a popular choice for both indoor bowlers and those playing lead outdoors. If you're looking to purchase a Taylor Lazer, online marketplaces such as eBay could be worth checking out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for indoor and outdoor use. It's a great choice for bowlers who frequently play on different types of surfaces. Available in sizes 00 to 5, this model is exclusively sold in the UK market. The Henselite Tiger Pro is one of the pricier options available, and it can be challenging to find second-hand options online. Ultimately, if you're looking for a reliable, high-quality bowl that can handle a variety of conditions, the Henselite Tiger Pro is a solid contender.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of bias, the Henselite Tiger Pro lawn bowl is considered a mid-biased bowl, while the Taylor Lazer is a narrow-biased bowl. The Lazer is the narrowest biased bowl in the Taylor range, making it ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens, but it should be avoided by those who predominantly play outdoors in the UK. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased bowl that is suitable for all bowlers, including those who play all year round both indoors and outdoors, with an ideal fit for all outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interestingly, both lawn bowls are designed for indoor and outdoor greens, but the difference in bias allows for different types of play. The narrow bias of the Lazer provides precision on fast greens, whereas the mid-bias of the Tiger Pro offers versatility and adaptability for a range of playing conditions. Ultimately, the choice between these two lawn bowls depends on individual playing style and preferences, and it's best to try them out on the greens to determine which one suits you best.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Taylor Lazer lawn bowls, we see that the Taylor Lazer features the Taylor Progrip, a widely praised dimple grip. In contrast, the Henselite Tiger Pro uses the Heneslite Mega grip, an embedded grip that sits deeper into the bowl. While an embedded grip can help bowlers who struggle with grip, some players may prefer the feel of a dimple grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to note that an embedded grip may make the bowl feel smaller in your hand, which can be a plus or a minus depending on personal preference. However, an embedded grip is generally considered superior to a dimple grip in terms of providing a secure and stable hold on the bowl. Ultimately, which grip you choose will depend on your individual needs and preferences.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the prices of the two popular models of lawn bowls, the Taylor Lazer and Henselite Tiger Pro, it is apparent that the latter is generally more expensive than the former. A brand new Henselite Tiger Pro can cost up to £400, while a Taylor Lazer only costs around £290. Even when purchasing second-hand, the price difference between the two models remains evident, with a used Henselite Tiger Pro selling for £250-£300, as opposed to a Taylor Lazer selling for just £150-£170.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it is important to note that the differences in price can largely be attributed to the varying levels of quality and features included in each model, rather than just branding alone. For instance, the Henselite Tiger Pro boasts a unique, ergonomic design aimed at improving grip and handling, and is also crafted using high-tech materials for greater durability and control. Meanwhile, the Taylor Lazer prioritizes affordability without sacrificing quality or performance. Ultimately, the price difference must be weighed up against individual needs and preferences to make an informed choice between the two models.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're a keen indoor bowler who primarily plays lead, then the Taylor Lazer could be the perfect bowl for you. Its narrow bias and indoor-focused design make it a great choice for players who want to excel in these conditions. However, if you're someone who likes to play both indoors and outdoors and wants a more versatile option, then the Henselite Tiger Pro could be the way to go. As a dual-purpose bowl, it's well-suited for a wide range of playing conditions and can be used effectively in a variety of positions within a team. The Tiger Pro is a flexible and reliable choice for any bowler looking to step up their game.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Lazer and the Henselite Tiger Pro are excellent lawn bowls with their own unique features that cater to different types of bowlers. The Taylor Lazer is perfect for those who primarily play indoor and lead on fast outdoor greens, while the Henselite Tiger Pro is ideal for those who play on a variety of surfaces. While the Taylor Lazer can be found on online marketplaces like eBay, the Henselite Tiger Pro is harder to find and more expensive. Ultimately, the choice between these two popular models will come down to personal preference and playing style.</p>
