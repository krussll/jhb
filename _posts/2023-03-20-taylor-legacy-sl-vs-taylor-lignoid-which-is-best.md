<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL is a wide-biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. It is an ideal choice for all outdoor surfaces and is particularly well-suited for skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5, the Legacy SL is currently only sold in the UK market. However, interested buyers can also find it on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay. With its wide bias and outdoor suitability, the Taylor Legacy SL is an excellent option for lawn bowl enthusiasts seeking a reliable and high-performing bowl.</p>

<p>The Taylor Lignoid is a wide-biased outdoor lawn bowl, designed for use on all outdoor surfaces, and comes in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. It is also suitable for skips, making it an ideal choice for bowlers of all levels. The Lignoid can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay, making it easy to add to your collection or replace your existing set.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lignoid and the Taylor Legacy SL are wide biased lawn bowls suitable for outdoor greens. The Legacy SL is best used on outdoor surfaces and should be avoided indoors. It falls in the middle of the Taylor range of bowls, while the Lignoid is the widest bowl in the range. The Lignoid is also ideal for outdoor greens and should be avoided if you predominantly play indoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although both bowls are wide biased and best suited for outdoor greens, the Legacy SL is considered less biased compared to the Lignoid. This means that the Legacy SL may be a better choice for players who want a more predictable line when throwing the bowl. The Lignoid, on the other hand, may be favored by players who want more aggressive bias to create a wider shot. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the individual player's preferences and playing style.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Legacy SL and the Taylor Lignoid lawn bowls come with the Taylor Progrip as standard, which is a dimple grip and widely regarded as one of the best. However, neither model offers the option of an embedded grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip is preferable for bowlers who struggle with grip, as it is set deeper into the bowl and can make it feel smaller in the hand. On the other hand, a dimple grip is a classic style grip where small divots or dimples run along the shoulder of the bowl. This allows for better fingertip grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while the two models of lawn bowls are similar in grip style, the choice between the Taylor Legacy SL and the Taylor Lignoid may come down to personal preference and individual needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the prices of the Taylor Legacy SL and the Taylor Lignoid lawn bowls, it's clear that both models are similarly priced. Both can be purchased new for around £290. If you're looking to save some money, purchasing either model second hand is also an option. The Taylor Legacy SL typically goes for around £100-£160, while the Taylor Lignoid can be found for around £90-£130.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the prices for these models of lawn bowls are quite reasonable for their quality and durability. It ultimately comes down to personal preference and which model you feel more comfortable with during gameplay. Whether you opt for the Taylor Legacy SL or the Taylor Lignoid, you can rest assured that you're investing in a quality lawn bowl.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Legacy SL and the Taylor Lignoid are wide biased bowls, designed for outdoor play. However, the Taylor Legacy SL specifically caters to outdoor players and should be avoided for indoor use. On the other hand, the Taylor Lignoid also suits outdoor play and is likely to perform well in indoor conditions too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are an outdoor player looking for a reliable bowl with a wide bias, the Taylor Legacy SL would be an excellent choice. However, if you prefer the flexibility of playing both indoor and outdoor, the Taylor Lignoid may better suit your needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between the two models depends on individual preferences and requirements. Consider factors such as playing style, green conditions, and personal preferences to decide which model of lawn bowl is right for you.</p>
