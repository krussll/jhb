<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Drakes Pride Professional and the PRO-50 are mid-biased bowls with similar biases and are ideal for both indoor and outdoor use. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2796} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference is that the PRO-50 has a deeper grip than the Professional, which may make it better for players who prefer a more secure grip on the bowl. However, the Professional may be more suitable for players who prefer a shallower grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2809} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both bowls are comparable in bias and are suitable for a variety of playing conditions. Choosing between the two may ultimately depend on personal preference and playing style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 has an embedded grip option, while the Drakes Pride Professional only comes with a standard dimple grip. An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the hand, which can benefit bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl. In contrast, the dimple grip is a classic style of grip featuring small divots along the bowl's shoulder, providing better grip for the fingertips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between the two depends on the individual bowler's preference and needs. Bowlers who have difficulty gripping the bowl may prefer the embedded grip option of the PRO-50, while others may favor the traditional dimple grip of the Professional. It is crucial to choose the right grip to achieve optimal performance and ensure a comfortable and secure grip during play.</p>

The Professional can be bought new for around £290, while the PRO-50 is priced at around £300. Both models have a wide range of prices when purchased second-hand, with the Professional ranging from £60-210 and the PRO-50 ranging from £190-260.</p>

The Professional is a classic model known for its consistent performance and durability, while the PRO-50 boasts a new and innovative design featuring a narrower bias, perfect for more experienced bowlers.</p>
