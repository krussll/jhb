<p>Throughout this guide, I'll be sharing the specs, bias, grip options, price, and who the bowls are best suited for. At the end of this post, you'll have a clear understanding of which bowl is the perfect fit for you. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid lawn bowl is a wide biased option designed for outdoor play, with a particular focus on skips. It works well on a variety of outdoor surfaces and is available in sizes ranging from 00 to 5, although it is only sold in the UK market. Additionally, those seeking the Taylor Lignoid can find it on online second hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC is a narrow biased lawn bowl that is perfect for indoor play or fast outdoor greens. It is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only in the UK market. Finding it on online second-hand marketplaces may be difficult, so buying them new is a more reliable option. Overall, it is an excellent bowl for indoor bowlers looking for a narrow bias.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of The Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowl and the Taylor Lignoid lawn bowl lies in their width of bias. The Lignoid has a wider bias compared to the D-TEC, making it ideal for outdoor greens. On the other hand, the D-TEC has a narrow bias, which makes it perfect for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. Therefore, the choice between the two bowls depends on the environment the player will be playing on.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the Lignoid is the widest bowl in the Taylor range, while the D-TEC is the narrowest biased bowl in the Drakes Pride range, making them suitable for different playing styles. The Legacy SL is recommended for all outdoor surfaces, whereas the D-TEC should be avoided if the player primarily plays outdoors in the UK.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, choosing between the Taylor Lignoid and the Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowl depends on the anticipated playing environment and the type of bias the player prefers. The Lignoid's wider bias is more suitable for outdoor greens, while the D-TEC's narrower bias is perfect for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of the Taylor Lignoid and Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowls, it's clear that they have different options available. The Taylor Lignoid comes with the Taylor Progrip, a proven dimple grip, but doesn't offer an embedded grip option. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride D-TEC only offers their standard dimple grip, which may not suit all bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip is a deeper grip set into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the hand. This can be useful for bowlers who struggle with a proper grip. However, a classic dimple grip, like the one on the Drakes Pride D-TEC, features small divots for fingers to sit in, offering a more traditional option. Though it's worth noting that the Taylor Progrip is considered one of the best dimple grips available. Ultimately, which grip to choose comes down to personal preference and how well it works for the individual bowler.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lignoid and Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowls are priced similarly. They can be purchased for around £290 when new, and used options are available for both models at lower prices. However, the price range for used Lignoid bowls is slightly lower, ranging from £90-130, while used D-TEC bowls can be found for around £120-200.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, when comparing the price of these two popular lawn bowls, it's clear that they fall within the same price range. The decision to purchase one over the other may depend on personal preferences in terms of brand and specific features of the bowl itself. It's important to carefully consider all factors when making a purchase of this nature to ensure you get the most value for your investment.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid is more suitable for outdoor bowlers due to its wide bias. If you mainly play outdoors, then it is a good choice for you. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride D-TEC is ideal for indoor bowlers, although it can also be played on faster outdoor surfaces. It is perfect for lead bowlers who play a significant role in teamplay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between these two models of lawn bowls comes down to your personal preferences and what type of environment you usually play in. If you play mainly outdoors, then the Taylor Lignoid is the better option, whereas the Drakes Pride D-TEC is perfect for indoor bowlers, particularly for those who frequently play lead.</p>
