<p>That's why I'm here to compare two popular choices: the Taylor Blaze and the Henselite Tiger TX. Throughout this guide, we'll take a look at the specs, the bias, the grip options, the price, and who each bowl will suit best. With this information, you'll have a much better idea of which bowl is the perfect match for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze lawn bowl is a mid-biased model suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It's a versatile option that works well on various surfaces and conditions. The UK market offers sizes ranging from 00 to 5. Additionally, the Taylor Blaze can be found on the secondary market, where you may be able to find a deal on this bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX is a narrow biased bowl that is best suited for indoor play or as a lead bowl on fast outdoor greens. It is only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and can be difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces. It is recommended to purchase this model new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX and Taylor Blaze lawn bowls have different biases. The Tiger TX is narrow biased, while the Blaze is mid-biased. The Tiger TX is designed for indoor rinks and is best suited for indoor bowlers, whereas the Blaze is ideal for indoor and outdoor greens and can be used by both indoor and outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the decision between these two bowls will depend on the individual's preference and the specific conditions of their play. Players who mainly play indoors may prefer the Tiger TX due to its narrow bias, while those who play on a variety of surfaces may opt for the Blaze's mid-bias. Ultimately, both bowls have their advantages and can enhance a player's game if used correctly.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze features the Taylor Premier grip which is similar to the Progrip but with oblong dimples instead of circles. However, the Blaze does not come with an embedded grip option. In contrast, the Henselite Tiger TX comes with the embedded Henselite Mega grip which is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the hand. This is especially beneficial for bowlers who struggle with grip. While the Blaze offers a classic style dimple grip, the Tiger TX offers a unique embedded grip option.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the prices of the Taylor Blaze and the Henselite Tiger TX, the latter tends to be more expensive. A brand new set of Tiger TX bowls will set you back around £420, while a new set of Taylor Blaze bowls can be bought for around £360. However, the price of second-hand sets is where things get interesting. While a second-hand set of Taylor Blaze bowls can be purchased for around £210-£230, the Tiger TX commonly sells for around £260-£310.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's worth noting that the price variation is not solely due to the brand name, but also factors like the age and condition of the bowls. Nevertheless, this does suggest that the Henselite Tiger TX is generally pricier than the Taylor Blaze. However, it's important to remember that the cost of the bowls shouldn't be the only factor considered when choosing a set. The size, weight, grip, and bias of the bowls should all be taken into account when making a decision.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze is a versatile lawn bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor surfaces. Its mid-biased characteristic is perfect for bowlers who want a balanced, easy-to-use bowl. The Blaze is a popular choice among experienced bowlers who value accuracy and precision on the green. It is also great for beginners who are looking for a reliable and easy-to-handle bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger TX is a very specific type of lawn bowl that is ideal for indoor bowlers, particularly those who often play the lead position. Its narrow bias makes it perfect for playing straight and accurate shots on indoor surfaces. However, it may not be the best option for outdoor bowlers as the narrow bias might make it difficult to adjust to varying weather conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Blaze and Henselite Tiger TX lawn bowls have specific characteristics that make them suitable for different types of bowlers. The Blaze is a versatile bowl that can be used both indoor and outdoor, while the Henselite Tiger TX is more specific to indoor bowlers, particularly those who often start in the lead position. Choosing the right lawn bowl ultimately depends on a bowler's individual preferences and playing style.</p>
