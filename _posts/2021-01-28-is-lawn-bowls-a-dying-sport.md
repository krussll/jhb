<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lawn bowls could be gone at an amatuer level in less than 15 years. Much is needed to save it. Here are my suggestions.</p>

<h2>Is lawn bowls a dying sport?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawn bowls is a popular game, played by millions around the world. It has a global TV reach and dedicated professional, and amateur players alike. However, lawn bowls as a sport needs to face facts. The game is slowly dying and has been for some time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is lawn bowls a dying sport? <strong>The sport may have grown through new countries and territories in recent decades, however, in its heartlands the sport is on the decline. I believe that without urgent and drastic action the sport could no longer be viable at an amatuer level in the next 15 years.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I am based in the UK I will be looking at this from a UK perspective - however much of what I say and believe will be true for other territories around the world.</p>

<h2><a href="#issues-facing-lawn-bowls"></a>Issues facing lawn bowls</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sport is facing many major issues. Before we can fix them and grow the sport, we must acknowledge what the issues are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#members-getting-older"></a>Members getting older</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The obvious issue is the average age of a bowler is getting higher. We will lose many of the generations who joined bowls in its heyday of the 70s and 80s over the next few decades.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The aging demographics also hardens the perception of bowls being an “old man’s game”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#not-attracting-young-players"></a>Not attracting young players</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Little is done to attract younger players to the sport. This is an issue I see at both national and local levels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems to be left to older players to bring their children and grand-children into clubs - leading to clubs dominated by 2 or 3 families.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only other players brought into clubs are the newly retired, drawn in by annual open days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#no-youth-set-upleagues"></a>No youth set up/leagues</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In many areas, there is no provision for youth players to play in any constructive leagues. Without this structure, games are either infrequent or simply don’t take place at an age-appropriate level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is not acceptable to have under 16s play in a senior league. It’s discouraging from a play standpoint, but also this is not an environment that is attractive to younger players, who want to practice, play and compete against their peers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#image-issue"></a>Image issue</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only as a predominantly retirees game but also a predominantly white sport.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is created by the previous 3 issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is presented as an “image” issue, however it's more of a “matter of fact” issue. The sport is older and less diverse, then any major sport that I can think of.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#disproportionately-affected-by-covid"></a>Disproportionately affected by COVID</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the restrictions put in place due to COVID-19 we are seeing bowls disproportionately affected. No members playing means more clubs going under.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><a href="https://www.cramlingtonbowlingclub.co.uk/cramlington-bowling-green-closure/">Cramlington Bowls Club</a> was one of many bowls clubs that had to close for the 2020 season</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clubs currently rely on a core of players to make up numbers in 4 rink leagues and friendlies. If even a small minority of these core players leave, then the number of leagues and teams would be untenable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#a-drop-in-membership-across-the-uk"></a>A drop in membership across the UK</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The number of players playing in the UK has dropped by a third since the turn of the millennium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the outcome from poor recruitment and an ever increasing number leaving the sport, either due to clubs going under, or ill health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>According to Bowls England there are 10 per cent fewer club members in the UK than there were just five years ago.</p><p><a href="https://www.itv.com/news/meridian/2019-09-25/why-is-lawn-bowls-struggling-to-attract-players0">itv.com</a></p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#club-closures"></a>Club closures</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clubs are becoming financially “at-risk”. This is a combination of losing players, rising costs, and dwindling cash reserves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The closure of clubs is being pushed on faster due to COVID-19 pandemic despite the best intentions and actions of <a href="https://www.bowlsengland.com/additional-funding-available-for-bowls-clubs/">Bowls England and UK Sport</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is still unknown how many clubs will close over the off-season. Many clubs will be concerned about making their normal number allocations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#leagues-spanning-large-areas"></a>Leagues spanning large areas</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Local leagues often span large distances. Mainly due to condensing leagues together. This makes playing league games harder for players with full-time jobs, as they struggle to make games after work - further pushing younger players out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Selectors like consistency and players with full-time jobs cannot offer the ability to play every week regardless of the start time, or distance required to travel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href="#a-global-issue"></a>A global issue</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowls isn’t just struggling in the UK, it’s also affected in its other major region, Australia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I will leave Nev Rodda, former Australian national champion to explain.</p>

<h2><a href="#the-outlook-for-lawn-bowls"></a>The Outlook for Lawn Bowls</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the uncertainty of how COVID will affect clubs in the 2021 summer season, and the 2021/22 indoor season we will not know for sometime the potential short-to-medium term consequences of the pandemic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This jolt to the sport has been looming for some time, and it could be that COVID-19 has simply sped up the likely long-term outcome:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Club closures</li><li>Players leaving the game at ametuer level</li><li>No young players joining the sport</li><li>Local leagues not having enough teams to complete a season</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is not too far-fetched to see a future where no competitive bowls are played in the UK if things continue as they are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href="#how-to-fix-bowls"></a>How to fix bowls</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I believe that there are ways for this to be prevented. HereI outline just a few actions that could be taken.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href="#exposure-in-mainstream"></a>Exposure in mainstream</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawn Bowls needs to get in-front of eyeballs. There is a jump in interest every year in January for the Indoor World Bowls championships which is shown on live tv. The same is true when the Commonwealth games comes around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We need more of these events shown regularly, both on terrestrial, online, or on subscription tv services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#more-competitions-on-free-to-air-tv"></a>More competitions on Free to Air TV</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The indoor championships make an impression - as we saw with the viral clip of Nicky Brett in 2019. Bowls can capture the interest of the population.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Free To Air channels struggle to compete for major sports (such as football and cricket) bowls as a sport has the opportunity to showcase all tournaments - both indoor and outdoor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as cricket is planning to do with “The Hundred”, bowls should be able to offer something less traditional for TV.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#relaxed-competitions"></a>Relaxed competitions</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The blueprint for such a tournament can be seen in Australia with the ABL and UBC. These are competitions made for television.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Uz0oGpUCrY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The relaxed, partisan approach is much more approachable for a casual audience. The days of the gentleman bowler are numbered, and people want something different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href="#changes-at-club-level"></a>Changes at club level</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Changes need to happen at club level to attract and retain players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#short-format-games"></a>Short format games</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At club level we need to introduce shorter forms of the game. It's very hard for newcomers to play friendlies when they are only taking 2 shots every 15 minutes. Short, more involved games would help encourage casual bowlers</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#dropreduce-4-rink-leagues"></a>Drop/reduce 4 rink leagues</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The time required to play and maintain a 4 rink league is excessive. At a club level we are already seeing clubs struggling to field full teams due to reduced membership. This will only continue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A game of Fours takes too long to play for a casual player, especially those who work and have young families. A commitment for multiple midweek leagues will be too much for them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More emphasis on shorter formats that can be played in 60-90 minutes would hopefully encourage players to play more frequently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#uk-commonwealth-games"></a>UK Commonwealth Games</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The UK has a great opportunity to showcase bowls when the Commonwealth Games are held in 2022. With all coverage shown live on BBC bowls should get substantial interest in the sport.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowls England will need to take advantage of this with proper promotion and outreach to hopefully attract this new audience to local bowls clubs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#creating-junior-local-leagues"></a>Creating junior local leagues</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is indicative of the struggles faced by lawn bowls when “young players” counts as anyone under the age of 40.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The problems faced by bowls will not go away in the future unless we can find pathways for juniors to play. Youth teams and leagues should become a priority.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href="#a-positive-note"></a>A positive note</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawn bowls is not a sitting duck. I believe it has the resources and a product that can capture the attention of audiences around the world, from any age bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll leave the last word to Nev Rodda, who had this to say on the future of bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I think with the right story in the right message in the right team this can absolutely be done</p><p>Nev Rodda</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I for one certainly hope he is right, for the future of our game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
