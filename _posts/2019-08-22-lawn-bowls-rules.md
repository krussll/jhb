<h2><a href="#the-object"></a>The Object</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The aim of lawn bowling is to roll your bowl as close to a smaller white ball (known as the jack) as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You want to get one or more of your bowls closer to the jack than your opponent</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href="#the-equipment"></a>The Equipment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are the <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/guide/what-equipment-do-you-need-for-lawn-bowls/" data-type="post" data-id="1368">basic items</a> needed for a game of bowls:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#the-jack"></a>The Jack</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The jack is a small ball - usually white, but sometimes yellow. Used as the target in the game. One is required for a game of bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#bowls"></a>Bowls</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are larger balls (referred to as "bowls" or "woods") that players use to roll towards the jack. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They weigh no more than 3.5 pounds and are weighted on one side which allows them to curve. The weighted side has a stamp on it so you know which side is which. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The number of <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/how-much-does-a-set-of-lawn-bowls-cost/" data-type="post" data-id="1458">bowls</a> each player requires differs depending on the number of players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#mats"></a>Mats</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two mats are required for a game, one is placed at either end of the green. Mats are made of rubber, and are roughly the size of a door mat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href="#playing-the-game"></a>Playing the Game</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A coin is tossed to decide which team bowl first. The first bowler places the mat. It must be placed centrally - see below for more details on how to place the mat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first bowler <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/how-to-deliver-the-jack-in-lawn-bowls/" data-type="post" data-id="1359">rolls the jack</a> to whatever distance they like. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only restrictions is it must be at least 25 meters from the mat, and must stay out of the ditch. There is usually a marker on the rink to show where the minimum distance is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the jack has come to rest it is placed centrally by the marker with the help of the bowler. The jack now becomes the target.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teams alternate taking shots. Each member of the team will take all of their shots before the next one takes over. When playing any shot the player bowling must always have one foot on the mat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any bowls that are in play can be moved by another shot, and they stay active to where they finish. <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/can-you-hit-the-jack-in-lawn-bowls/" data-type="post" data-id="1150">This includes the jack.</a> Any <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/lawn-bowls-rules-when-the-jack-is-in-the-ditch/" data-type="post" data-id="499">bowl that finishes in the ditch</a> is considered out of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once all players have finished their shots the <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/how-do-points-work-in-lawn-bowls/" data-type="post" data-id="1160">game is scored.</a> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winning side gets one point for each bowl that is closer to the jack than their opponent's nearest bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winning team will get to go first on the next "end". </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will be played in the opposite direction to the previous end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What are the lawn bowls mat placement rules? <strong>The mat must be placed by the bowler about to roll the jack. The mat must be placed centrally and squarely in line with the rink markers, with the front edge of the mat being at least 2 meters (6ft 6in) away from the ditch and the front edge no more than 25 meters (82ft) from the ditch.</strong></p>

<p>6.1.1 Before the start of play in each end, the player to play first must place the centre line of the mat lengthwise along the centre line of the rink, with the mat line at least 2 metres from the rear ditch and at least 25 metres from the front ditch.</p>

<h2><a href="#number-of-players-bowls-and-ends"></a>Number of players, bowls and ends</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The number of bowls, and how many ends are played is usually determined by the format of the game, namely how many players are on a team. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a general overview of the <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/how-long-does-a-game-of-lawn-bowls-take/" data-type="post" data-id="1005">number of ends and number of bowls</a> required for each format</p>

<h2>Common variations</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are some common variations to the stars game setup described above. We'll go over a few of these now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>"First to X" number of shots. This is a common one for singles play. Instead of playing for a certain number of ends, you play until someone gets to a specific score. This is usually "first to 21" and in tight games it can make for a tense (and sometimes very long!) game</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>the highest number of ends won.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>the highest number of sets. These act almost like "mini games" of 9 ends. Best of 3 games is the winner</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>2 wood games. Again, another variation on the singles format. In this game each player only gets two bowls. This is a true test of a players' lead abilities</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p><strong>The minimum jack length is 23 meters.</strong> This is measured once the jack has come to rest, and is placed in the centre of the rink. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The measurement is taken in a straight line from the centre of the mat, to the nearest point of the jack.</p>

<p>If the jack is under 23 meters from the mat the jack is given to the opposition. They will then have to opportunity to re-place the mat and to deliver the jack.</p>
