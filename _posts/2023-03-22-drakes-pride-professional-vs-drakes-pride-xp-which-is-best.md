<p>We'll be looking at the specs, bias, grip options, price, and who will benefit most from each bowl. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clear idea of which bowl is best for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2685} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowl is a versatile mid-biased bowl that can be used both indoors and outdoors on a variety of surfaces and conditions. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only and can be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay. This bowl is a great choice for those who want a bowl that can adapt to different playing conditions and can be used in a variety of venues.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride XP is a lawn bowl with a wide bias, making it well-suited for outdoor play on all surfaces. It's particularly ideal for skips and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. While it can be difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay, purchasing a new set is likely the best route.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride XP and Professional lawn bowls differ in their levels of bias. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2801} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The XP has a wider bias, making it ideal for outdoor greens and suitable for all outdoor surfaces. In contrast, the Professional is a mid-biased bowl that falls between the D-TEC and XP in the Drakes Pride range. It is suitable for both indoor and outdoor rinks and bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the bias of these two bowls should be considered when selecting the best one for your needs. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2809} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The XP is better suited for outdoor use, while the Professional can be used in various settings. However, it's important to note that personal preferences and skill level can also play a significant role in bowl selection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the grips of the Drakes Pride XP and Drakes Pride Professional, both models feature a standard dimple grip. This classic style of grip has small divots along the shoulder of the bowl which allows bowlers to have a better grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Professional is only offered with this type of grip, while the XP also has an embedded grip option. The embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the bowler's hand. This can be beneficial for those who have difficulty gripping the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between the two models may come down to personal preference in terms of grip style. The classic dimple grip found on both models is a tried and true option, while the embedded grip of the XP offers a unique alternative for those seeking a more customized feel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price comparison between the Drakes Pride Professional and the Drakes Pride XP, there is no clear winner. Both models can be bought new for around £290. However, when purchasing a second-hand set, the prices vary. The Professional can be found for a lower price range of £60-210, while the XP's second-hand price ranges from £140-250.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to keep in mind that the price difference between the two models may be due to factors like the age, condition, and rarity of the bowls. Additionally, the difference in price may simply reflect the preferences of bowlers, as some may find the XP to be a better fit for their playing style, while others may prefer the Professional.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision on which model to choose will come down to personal preference and budget. Whether you opt for the Professional or the XP, both models are top-quality lawn bowls that can improve your game and provide years of enjoyment on the green.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to choosing between the Drakes Pride Professional and Drakes Pride XP lawn bowls, the decision largely depends on the surface you'll be playing on. The Professional model is versatile enough to be used both indoors and outdoors, thanks to its mid-biased design. If you plan on playing on a variety of surfaces, this may be the model for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the XP model is specifically designed for outdoor play. Its wide bias makes it ideal for use on uneven, unpredictable terrain. If you primarily play on outdoor greens, this is likely the better choice for you. However, if you ever plan on transitioning to indoor play, the XP may not be the most versatile option. Ultimately, the choice between the two models comes down to your individual playing style and preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Drakes Pride XP and Drakes Pride Professional are popular choices for lawn bowlers. While the Professional is more versatile for both indoor and outdoor play, the XP is specifically designed for use on outdoor surfaces and is ideal for skips. The availability of the XP may pose an issue for those looking for second-hand options. Ultimately, the choice between these two models will come down to personal preference and specific playing needs.</p>
