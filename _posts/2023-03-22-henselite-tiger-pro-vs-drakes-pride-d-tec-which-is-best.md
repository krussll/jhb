<p>In this blog post, I'm comparing two popular models - the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Drakes Pride D-TEC. We'll dive into the specs, bias, grip options, price, and who these bowls are best for. By the end of this guide, you'll have all the information you need to make an informed decision and choose the best bowl for you. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2726} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro is a high-end lawn bowl with a mid-biased formula that makes it perfect for indoor and outdoor play on different surfaces. It comes in various sizes ranging from 00 to 5, albeit only for the UK market. This bowl is hard to find on online second-hand marketplaces, and it's best to buy them new due to their expensiveness. Overall, the Henselite Tiger Pro is an excellent choice for seasoned bowlers who want a high-performance bowl that's suitable for any surface.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC is a highly specialized lawn bowl, with a narrow bias that makes it perfect for indoor play and outdoor greens with fast speeds. Available in sizes 00 to 5 (although only for the UK market), it can be difficult to find secondhand online, so purchasing new may be the best option. Ideal for indoor bowlers or lead players on fast outdoor greens, the Drakes Pride D-TEC is a must-have for those wanting a highly precise and niche bowl.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro and the Drakes Pride D-TEC are two different models of lawn bowls, each with their own bias. The Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased bowl, suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2798} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is especially ideal for those who play year-round both indoors and outdoors. In contrast, the Drakes Pride D-TEC is a narrow-biased bowl, suited for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. It is recommended for indoor bowlers and should be avoided if you primarily play outdoors in the UK. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the bias of each bowl will depend on personal preference and the specific playing conditions.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro lawn bowl comes with an embedded grip called the Henselite Mega grip. This grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand. It is a great option for bowlers who struggle to grip the bowl properly. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowl only comes with their standard dimple grip. This classic grip style features small divots along the shoulder of the bowl to allow your fingers to sit in and provide a better grip.</p>

<p>Overall, the Henselite Tiger Pro and Drakes Pride D-TEC have different grip options. The Henselite Tiger Pro has an embedded grip while the Drakes Pride D-TEC only features their standard dimple grip. Bowlers who have difficulty gripping may want to consider the Henselite Tiger Pro with its deep set Mega grip, while bowlers who prefer a classic grip may prefer the Drakes Pride D-TEC with its dimple grip.</p>

<p>While the cost of these two models may be a significant consideration for some bowlers, it is essential to note that the price can vary depending on several factors, such as the size and weight of the bowls. The Henselite Tiger Pro may be more expensive, but it is also known for its precision and accuracy, making it an excellent choice for professional and experienced bowlers.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to choosing a lawn bowl model, it's important to consider your personal preferences and playing style. If you're a bowler who enjoys playing both indoors and outdoors and wants a versatile bowl that can be played in multiple positions, then the Henselite Tiger Pro would be a great fit for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, if you're primarily an indoor bowler who plays lead, then the Drakes Pride D-TEC narrow biased bowl would be a more suitable choice.
