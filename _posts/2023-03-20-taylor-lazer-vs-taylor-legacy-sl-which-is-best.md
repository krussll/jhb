<p>Don't worry if you're not familiar with the varieties of bowls available - I'll walk you through the differences in specs, the bias, grip options, and even pricing. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clear understanding of which bowl suits you the best. Let's get started, shall we?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer is a narrow biased bowl designed for indoor play, but can also be used on fast outdoor greens. It is an ideal bowl for lead players and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only. The Taylor Lazer can be found on online marketplaces like eBay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL is a wide bias lawn bowl perfect for outdoor play. It has been designed to suit all outdoor surfaces and is best suited for skips. The bowl comes in various sizes ranging from 00 to 5, which are available for the UK market only. You can also find this model in second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the Taylor Legacy SL and the Taylor Lazer lawn bowl is their bias. The Taylor Lazer has a narrow bias, which makes it ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. On the other hand, the Taylor Legacy SL has a wide bias, which makes it suitable for outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both bowls have their specific uses, the Lazer should be avoided if you play predominantly outdoors in the UK, and the Legacy SL should be avoided if you play predominantly indoors. The Legacy SL is between the International and the Lignoid in the Taylor range, whereas the Lazer is the narrowest biased bowl in the Taylor range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the two bowls will depend on the type of surface you usually play on. The Lazer is better suited for faster indoor surfaces, while the Legacy SL is better suited for outdoor greens. It's important to consider the conditions in which you'll use the bowls to make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Legacy SL come with the Taylor Progrip, which is a dimple grip and widely regarded as one of the best in the market. However, unlike the Taylor Lazer, the Taylor Legacy SL has no option for an embedded grip. Many bowlers prefer an embedded grip as it is set deeper into the bowl, making it easier to grip for those who struggle with holding the bowl properly. On the other hand, the dimple grip offers a classic style of grip, with small divots along the bowl's shoulder. This allows bowlers' fingertips to sit in the dimples, providing a better grip while the bowl is released. Overall, while both grips are high-quality, the choice between the two ultimately depends on one's personal preference and grip strength.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lazer and Taylor Legacy SL are popular models of lawn bowls, but when it comes to price, there are some differences. The Taylor Lazer is generally more expensive, with a new set costing around £290, and a second-hand set going for around £150-£170. On the other hand, the Taylor Legacy SL is slightly more affordable, with a new set also going for around £290, but a second-hand set being available for around £100-£160.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When deciding which model to go for, price is definitely a consideration. While both sets are high-quality and come from a well-respected manufacturer, the price difference may sway a budget-conscious buyer towards the Legacy SL. However, it's important to remember that the Taylor Lazer has its own unique features and may be worth the extra investment for those who prioritize certain qualities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Lazer and Taylor Legacy SL are worth considering for anyone who wants a reliable and well-made set of lawn bowls. The price difference may play a role in the decision-making process, but ultimately, personal preferences and needs should be the deciding factor.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on the above descriptions, the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Legacy SL are designed for different types of bowlers. The Taylor Lazer is narrow biased and best suited for indoor bowlers, especially those who play lead position. On the other hand, the Taylor Legacy SL is wide biased and ideal for outdoor play, making it a good choice for those who focus solely on outdoor games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are an indoor bowler who often plays lead, the Taylor Lazer would be a suitable option for you. This bowl’s narrow bias allows for a straighter shot, making it easier to control and aim accurately. However, if you play solely outdoors, the Taylor Legacy SL would be a better choice due to its wider bias and better performance on grass greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Legacy SL have their strengths and target audiences. Your choice between them should depend on the type of bowling you primarily engage in and your playing position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Lazer and Taylor Legacy SL are great lawn bowls for their respective purposes. The Taylor Lazer is perfect for indoor play while the Taylor Legacy SL is suited for all outdoor surfaces and is ideal for skips. Both models are available in sizes from 00 to 5 for the UK market and can be found on online second hand marketplaces such as eBay.
