<p>In this blog post, I will be comparing two popular models - the Taylor International and Henselite Tiger TX - to help you make an informed decision. We'll cover everything from specs, bias, grip options, price, and even who these bowls are suited for. By the end of this guide, you'll have all the information you need to choose the perfect lawn bowl for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International is a versatile lawn bowl with a mid-to-wide bias, making it well-suited for outdoor play. Available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market, this bowl can be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions. Additionally, the Taylor International can even be found secondhand on online marketplaces such as eBay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX is a narrow biased lawn bowl that is specifically designed for indoor play or for those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. It is only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, making it a bit harder to find on online second-hand marketplaces. Additionally, it is recommended to purchase them new to ensure their quality. Overall, the Henselite Tiger TX is an excellent choice for competitive indoor bowlers or those playing on speedy outdoor greens.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of bias, the Henselite Tiger TX and Taylor International lawn bowls have significant differences. The Tiger TX is a narrow biased bowl, best suited for indoor rinks, while the International is a midbiased/wide biased bowl, ideal for various outdoor surfaces. The Tiger TX is suited to indoor bowlers and should be avoided for those who predominantly play outdoors in the UK, while the International is designed for outdoor greens.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the International sits between the Ace and the Legacy in the Taylor range, indicating its versatility and suitability for a wide range of players. Meanwhile, the Tiger TX is the narrowest biased bowl in the Henselite range, making it a popular option among indoor bowlers who prefer a narrower biased bowl. Both bowls have unique characteristics that cater to different playing styles and environments, highlighting the importance of choosing the right bowl for your personal preferences and playing conditions.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of the Henselite Tiger TX and the Taylor International lawn bowls, one key difference is that the Tiger TX comes with an embedded grip, while the Taylor International features a dimple grip as standard. An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, which can make it feel smaller in your hand and help bowlers who struggle with grip. On the other hand, a dimple grip is a classic style of grip where small indentations run along the shoulder of the bowl, designed to provide better grip for your fingertips.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Taylor International doesn't come with an embedded grip option, it does feature the highly regarded Progrip, which is considered one of the best dimple grips available. However, an embedded grip is generally seen as superior to a dimple grip, which suggests that the Henselite Tiger TX's Heneslite Mega grip may have an advantage in this category. Ultimately, though, the best grip for you will depend on your personal preferences and needs as a bowler.</p>

The Taylor International, on the other hand, is known for its affordability and versatility, making it a popular choice for beginner and intermediate bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>In comparing the Taylor International and the Henselite Tiger TX, it is clear that these two popular models of lawn bowls are suited to different types of bowlers. The Taylor International is mid-biased and versatile, suitable for those who enjoy playing outdoors and on different surfaces. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger TX is narrow biased and designed for indoor use, making it more suitable for lead bowlers who prefer indoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>If you are an outdoor bowler who likes to vary the surfaces on which you play, the versatility of the Taylor International would be ideal for you.
