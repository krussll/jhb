<h2>Spec</h2>

It is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only and is best suited for experienced players. Unlike other popular models, such as the Aero GrooVe, the Tiger TX is difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces, so it is recommended to purchase them new.

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX and the Aero GrooVe lawn bowls differ in terms of their bias. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2835} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger TX is a narrow biased bowl, making it suited for indoor rinks and indoor bowlers. It is not recommended for outdoor use in the UK. On the other hand, the Aero GrooVe is a mid-biased bowl that lies between the Quantum and Sonic models in the Aero range. This makes it ideal for both indoor and outdoor use, making it a suitable choice for both indoor and outdoor bowlers.</p>

<p>Overall, the Henselite Tiger TX and the Aero GrooVe lawn bowls have different biases that cater to different environments and bowlers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2822} /-->

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX comes standard with the embedded Henselite Mega grip, while the Aero GrooVe offers a variety of grip options, including embedded, dimpled, and non-gripped options. The embedded grip on the Tiger TX is set deeper into the bowl, which can be beneficial for bowlers struggling with grip. In contrast, the dimple grip on the Aero GrooVe features small divots that enable your fingertips to grip better. It is worth noting that Aero offers all of its grip options on its entire range, including the Quantum and Sonic, while Henselite's Mega grip is specific to the Tiger TX.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>The Henselite Tiger TX and the Aero GrooVe are two popular models of lawn bowls. The Henselite Tiger TX is best suited for indoor bowlers, particularly those who play in the lead position.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, while both the Henselite Tiger TX and the Aero GrooVe have their advantages, the Aero GrooVe seems to be the more versatile option.
