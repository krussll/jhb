<p>But, don't worry! In this blog post, I'll be comparing two of the most popular models - the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger - to help you make an informed decision. I'll be delving into the bowls' specs, bias, grip options, and even their price ranges. By the end of this guide, you'll have a better understanding of which bowl is the right choice for you. So, let's get started, shall we?</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a lawn bowl with a narrow bias designed for fast indoor and outdoor play. It is suited for indoor players or those who prefer to play lead on quick outdoor greens. The bowl comes in sizes 00 to 5 and is available only in the UK. It can be purchased new or second-hand through online marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide-biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. It is perfect for all types of outdoor surfaces and is particularly suited for skilled players in the position of skip. The bowl is available in the UK market only, with sizes ranging from 00 to 5. However, it may be challenging to find this model on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay. Therefore, it is recommended to purchase this bowl new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of bias, the Henselite Tiger and the Taylor Vector VS lawn bowls are quite different. The Tiger has a wide bias, which makes it suitable for outdoor surfaces and not recommended for indoor play. On the other hand, the Vector VS has a narrow bias, making it ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger is one of the widest bowls in the Henselite range, and its bias is best suited for outdoor greens where the surface is unpredictable. Meanwhile, the Vector VS is a narrower bowl, making it more suitable for indoor bowlers and lead outdoor bowlers. These differences in bias make each bowl better suited for different types of surfaces, so it's important to choose the right one depending on where you will be playing.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparing the grips of the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger, we can see that there are different types of grip available. The Taylor Vector VS comes with a dimple grip called the Progrip, which is considered one of the best dimple grips available. However, the Taylor Vector VS does not offer an embedded grip option. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger comes with an embedded grip called the Henselite Mega grip. The benefit of an embedded grip is that it is set deeper into the bowl, which can make the bowl feel smaller in your hand and help with gripping the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between the two grips depends on personal preference and any specific needs or concerns a bowler may have. While the Taylor Vector VS offers a top-notch dimple grip, the Henselite Tiger's embedded grip may be more beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. It's important to consider all factors before making a decision on which lawn bowl model to purchase.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the price of the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger, it is clear that the Taylor Vector VS is the more affordable option. With a brand new price of £360 and second-hand prices ranging from £160-£190, the Vector VS is a more budget-friendly option for lawn bowl enthusiasts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger is a pricier option, with a brand new price of around £400 and second-hand prices ranging from £200-£690 for the Tiger II model. While the Tiger II does offer some additional features, such as enhanced grip and stability, it may not be worth the extra cost for those on a tight budget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger will depend on individual preferences and budget constraints. While the Tiger is a premium option for more experienced players with larger budgets, the Vector VS offers a more affordable option for beginners or those looking to save money.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparing the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger lawn bowls, it's clear that each bowl is suited for a particular type of bowler and playing environment. The Taylor Vector VS is a narrow biased bowl, making it ideal for indoor bowlers who often play on faster surfaces. Its design also makes it particularly well-suited for lead players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger is a wide biased bowl designed specifically for outdoor play. As such, it should be avoided if you play primarily indoors. However, if you're an outdoor bowler, the Tiger's wider bias makes it an excellent choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger are both high-quality lawn bowls, but their differing biases and intended uses mean that they would best suit different types of players and environments. If you play primarily indoors and need a bowl for lead play, the Taylor Vector VS is likely the better choice for you. If you're strictly an outdoor player, the Henselite Tiger is likely the better fit.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, the Taylor Vector VS and Henselite Tiger are both excellent options for lawn bowl enthusiasts, but they are designed for different playing conditions and positions within the team. The Taylor Vector VS is perfect for those playing indoors or on fast outdoor greens, while the Henselite Tiger is a wide biased bowl that can handle all types of outdoor surfaces and is best suited for skips. While both models are available in the same sizes for the UK market, acquiring a second-hand Henselite Tiger may be more challenging due to their popularity, making purchasing new the most realistic option. Ultimately, the decision between these two models will depend on the individual needs and preferences of the player.</p>
