<p>Together, we'll look at the specifications, bias, grip options, and pricing of these bowls, so you can make an informed decision. By the end of this guide, you'll have a better understanding of which bowl is the perfect match for you. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze is a versatile and mid-biased lawn bowl model suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It can be used on various surfaces and conditions, making it an ideal choice for bowlers who want a versatile and adaptable bowl. The Blaze comes in sizes 00 to 5, available only in the UK market, and can sometimes be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. Overall, the Taylor Blaze is a great option for bowlers looking for a reliable, versatile bowl that can handle different playing conditions.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride XP is a wide-biased lawn bowl suitable for outdoor play. Its wide bias makes it an excellent choice for all types of outdoor surfaces, and it's particularly well-suited for skip players. Available in sizes 00 to 5 (for the UK market only), the Drakes Pride XP can be challenging to find on second-hand marketplaces such as eBay, so new purchases may be necessary.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of the Drakes Pride XP and the Taylor Blaze is the direction in which they turn. The XP is a wide-biased bowl, meaning it will turn more sharply towards the outside of the rink. This makes it ideal for outdoor greens as it can handle longer distances and has a more pronounced curve. The Blaze, on the other hand, is a mid-biased bowl, which offers a more balanced and predictable curve. It is suited for both indoor and outdoor greens and can handle a range of surfaces.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another difference between the two models is their placement within their respective brands. The Blaze is positioned between the Vector VS and the Ace in the Taylor range, suggesting that it is a versatile bowl for various playing conditions. Conversely, the XP is the widest bowl in the Drakes Pride range, indicating that it is specifically designed for experienced outdoor players who require a more extreme bias to handle larger greens. Ultimately, the choice between the two models will depend on personal preference and playing style.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Blaze and the Drakes Pride XP lawn bowls come with different grips options. The Taylor Blaze comes with the Taylor Premier grip, which is oblong-shaped dimples, while the Drakes Pride XP only comes with their standard dimple grip. The Blaze does not offer an embedded grip option, while the XP does not provide any additional grip options.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip is deeper into the bowl and helps bowlers with grip problems. However, dimple grips are a classic style and provide better grip by allowing the fingers to sit in the divots. Overall, while the Blaze offers a unique oblong-shaped dimple grip, the XP provides a standard but reliable dimple grip with the option for an embedded grip.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>

The Taylor Blaze is generally more expensive, with a new set costing £360 and a second-hand set selling for around £210-£230. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is more affordable, with a new set costing around £290 and a second-hand set selling for around £140-250.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to note that the price of lawn bowls can vary depending on several factors, such as the quality of the materials used and the level of craftsmanship applied. However, both the Taylor Blaze and the Drakes Pride XP are highly regarded by bowlers around the world, and are known for their durability, precision and performance on the green. Ultimately, the decision on which model to choose will depend on individual preferences and needs, as well as the budget available.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on their respective bias, it is clear that the Taylor Blaze would be ideal for individuals who play on a variety of surfaces, whether indoor or outdoor. Those who seek versatility in their lawn bowls should go for the Taylor Blaze.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is targeted towards players who participate solely in outdoor games. If you have a preference for outdoor lawn bowling, the wide bias of the Drakes Pride XP makes it a great choice. However, it’s essential to keep in mind that this bowl is not suitable for indoor gameplay due to its bias.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, it’s important to understand your playing preferences before selecting a bowling model. The Taylor Blaze is an all-rounder, while the Drakes Pride XP focuses on outdoor play.
