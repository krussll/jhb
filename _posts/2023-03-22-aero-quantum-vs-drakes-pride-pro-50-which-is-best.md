<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2709} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum lawn bowl is a narrow bias bowl that is best suited for indoor play or fast outdoor greens. It is recommended for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. The bowl comes in sizes 00 to 5, but is only available in the UK market. It is worth noting that the Aero Quantum is a bit harder to find on second hand marketplaces such as eBay and it may be necessary to buy them new.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 model of lawn bowls is a mid-biased bowl, making it ideal for both indoor and outdoor play. Its versatility allows it to be used on various surfaces and conditions, making it a popular choice among bowlers. This bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. In addition, it can also be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference in bias between the Aero Quantum and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 is that the Quantum is narrow biased while the PRO-50 is mid-biased. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2826} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Quantum is the narrowest bowl in the Aero range and is best suited for indoor rinks and outdoor greens. On the other hand, the PRO-50 has the same bias as the Professional bowl but with a deeper grip and is in between the D-TEC and the XP in the Drakes Pride range. Like the Quantum, it is ideal for indoor and outdoor play.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between these two bowls will depend on the player's personal preference and their style of play. The narrow bias of the Quantum may be better suited for those who prefer a straighter line of delivery, while the mid-bias of the PRO-50 may be more suitable for players who prefer a more curved path. Ultimately, it is recommended that players try out both of these bowls to determine which one works best for them.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of the Aero Quantum and the Drakes Pride PRO-50, it's important to note the variety of options offered by Aero. They provide a range of grip options, including dimpled, embedded, and non-gripped, all available as standard and at no extra cost. This means that bowlers can choose the option that works best for them without worrying about additional expenses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 only offers an embedded grip option. This type of grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller and providing a secure hold for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. However, the lack of other grip options may be limiting for some bowlers who prefer a different style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Aero Quantum provides a more diverse range of grips, while the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offers a reliable embedded grip option for bowlers who need it. It's up to individual preference and hand size which would be the best choice for any given bowler.</p>
