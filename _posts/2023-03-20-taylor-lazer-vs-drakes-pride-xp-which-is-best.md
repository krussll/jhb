<p>That's why in this post, I'll be walking you through a comparison of two top-rated models - the Taylor Lazer and the Drakes Pride XP. Together, we'll be exploring the specs, bias, grip options, pricing, and who each bowl would be best suited for. By the time you finish reading, you'll have a much clearer idea of which lawn bowl is the perfect fit for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer is a narrow bias lawn bowl that is well-suited for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, this bowl is popular among indoor bowlers and those who play lead. It is also available on second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride XP is a wide-biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. With its versatile bias, it suits various outdoor surfaces and is particularly suited to skips. These bowls are available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, but they're not readily available on second-hand marketplaces like eBay. If you want to get your hands on a set of Drakes Pride XP bowls, it's best to buy them new.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of The Drakes Pride XP lawn bowl and the Taylor Lazer lawn bowl is that the XP is a wide biased bowl, while the Lazer is a narrow biased bowl. This means that the XP is more suitable for outdoor greens, while the Lazer is better for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. The XP is also suitable for all outdoor surfaces, while the Lazer should be avoided if you plan to play predominantly outdoors in the UK.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, if you're looking for a bowl for indoor rinks or fast outdoor greens, the Taylor Lazer is a good option, whereas if you're playing on outdoor greens, The Drakes Pride XP is more suitable. It's important to consider which type of surface you'll be playing on before choosing a bowl with the right bias.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the grips of lawn bowls, the Taylor Lazer and Drakes Pride XP have different options. The Taylor Lazer comes with the Taylor Progrip, a dimple grip that is considered one of the best around. However, the Taylor Lazer does not offer the option of an embedded grip, which is typically considered even better than a dimple grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the Drakes Pride XP only offers the standard dimple grip. While this classic style has been popular for many years, some bowlers may prefer a deeper grip that makes the bowl feel smaller in their hand. This can be especially helpful for those who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and what feels most comfortable and secure for the individual bowler.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Taylor Lazer and the Drakes Pride XP, it is clear that they are relatively similar. Both new models can be purchased for around £290, which is a considerable investment for a lawn bowl. However, if purchasing a second-hand model, then there is a difference in price range. The Taylor Lazer can be bought between £150-£170, while the Drakes Pride XP is priced between £140-£250.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Considering the pricing range, there does not seem to be a significant difference to choose one model over another based on cost alone. However, it is essential to consider the features and reputation of each model. The Taylor Lazer is known for its accuracy and control due to its narrow bias. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP model is favored by those who value a wider holding position and a smoother delivery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, when deciding on which lawn bowl to purchase, it is crucial to weigh up the price range against the features and benefits that each model brings to the table. Ultimately, it is a personal decision based on the needs and preferences of the player.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the two popular models of lawn bowls, the Taylor Lazer would best suit indoor bowlers who frequently play lead. Being a narrow biased bowl, it is designed to perform well on indoor surfaces. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP would be a better option for those who solely play outdoors. This wide biased bowl is made to excel on outdoor surfaces, though it should be avoided if you play indoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, choosing the right lawn bowl depends on where and how frequently you play. If you mainly play indoors and lead, the Taylor Lazer is a great choice. If you play outdoors exclusively, the Drakes Pride XP will likely be your go-to. However, if you play on a variety of surfaces, it may be worth considering a more versatile option that can perform well in different conditions.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Lazer and Drakes Pride XP are popular models of lawn bowls with their own unique characteristics. The Taylor Lazer is ideal for indoor play and is best for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is designed for outdoor play and is perfect for all outdoor surfaces, making it ideal for skips.

Ultimately, when choosing between these two models, it is important to consider your playing style and the type of surface you will be playing on.</p>
