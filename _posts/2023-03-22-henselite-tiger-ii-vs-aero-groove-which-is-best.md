<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II is more suited for indoor use and fast outdoor greens, while the GrooVe is ideal for indoor and outdoor use on a variety of terrains. It ultimately depends on the bowler's preference and the specific terrain they will be playing on when choosing between these two lawn bowls.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II comes with an embedded Heneslite Mega grip as standard, making it feel smaller in the hand and suitable for bowlers who struggle with grip. Conversely, the Aero GrooVe has three grip options available, including an embedded grip, a dimple grip, and a non-gripped option, with all grips coming as standard at no extra cost. The dimple grip is a classic style that features small divots along the shoulder of the bowl to give better grip to the finger tips. Overall, the Aero GrooVe offers more grip options than the Henselite Tiger II, ensuring that every bowler can find a grip that suits them.</p>

Its dual-purpose design and flexibility allow it to perform well on various surfaces, making it suitable for all players. In addition, its ability to be used in multiple positions makes it a popular choice for many teams.
