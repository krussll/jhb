<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawn bowls is a<a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/jokes-about-lawn-bowls/"> friendly and pleasant sport</a> to take part in. It doesn’t take long to notice how tight-knit the community is, and members seem to get along with little to no problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, lawn bowls is competitive, so having a few tricks up your sleeve is highly recommended.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#1-practice-practice-practice"></a>1. Practice, practice, practice.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We can’t say it enough. To get better at your game, you need to be training at least 3 to 4 times a week minimum. This means getting together with other team members and playing together. Sure, you can always work on your technique alone, but to really hone your skills, you need to be challenging yourself against other players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#2-focus"></a>2. Focus</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good player knows never to focus on the target, but the road on which you aim to deliver your bowl. Take your time before delivering, and don’t worry too much if it doesn’t go the way you plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#3-sharpen-your-game-with-drills"></a>3. Sharpen Your Game With Drills</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The weight-controlled exercises listed below will help you improve physically and mentally. The aim of these drills is to help you to gauge the power each bowl needs to travel a certain distance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><a href="#method-one"></a>Method One</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roll the bowl a short length and as close to the center line as possible. Then increase the length of every bowl after. If a bowl fails to pass the previous one, repeat that particular bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you have completed the game, start bowling in the opposite direction. This time, roll the first bowl a long length, and decrease the length of every bowl after.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><a href="#method-two"></a>Method Two</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Place two discs (or CD’s if you still have any!) either 6 or 8 meters apart. Roll the first bowl just past the disc closest to you. Play the last three bowls, making sure each one rolls further than the previous. The aim of this drill is to finish with all four bowls between the two discs. Again, if a bowl fails to pass the previous one, repeat the bowl.</p>

<h3><a href="#4-be-competitive"></a>4. Be Competitive</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re serious about improving, try thinking of every training session as a competition. Look at the way the other players bowl, look at their technique. What are they doing differently to you?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If possible, ask to train with senior members. They will often be more than happy to help and are bound to have heaps of experience.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#6-record-results"></a>6. Record Results</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#think-about-your-mat-position"></a>Think About Your Mat Position</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Step onto the same spot on the mat every time. This may be difficult to do if playing on uneven ground as your brain may struggle to comprehend the path your bowl is going to take.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#position-your-feet-and-shoulders"></a>Position Your Feet And Shoulders</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After you pivot your feet towards your point of aim, keep your shoulders square as you swing to deliver. Your arm should not cross your torso, but instead swing in a straight line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#avoid-floppy-arms"></a>Avoid Floppy Arms</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You will only get any decent weight control if your arm is moved in a controlled manner. This doesn’t mean it should be rigid, but it should move almost gracefully like a pendulum. The more you practice your swing, the better you will remember how to do it.</p>
