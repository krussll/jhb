<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. It is suitable for all outdoor surfaces and is particularly suited to skips.

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace offers the Progrip and the Taylor Xtreme grip as standard options. The Progrip is a top class dimple grip while the Xtreme grip is an embedded grip. Both options cater to everyone's preference regarding the grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the Henselite Tiger comes with the Henselite Mega grip as standard, which is an embedded grip. This grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller and easier to grip for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice of grip comes down to personal preference, and both the Taylor Ace and Henselite Tiger offer excellent grip options. The embedded grip offered by the Henselite Tiger may be more suitable for those who have difficulty with grip, while the Taylor Ace provides a classic dimple grip option.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the price of the Taylor Ace and the Henselite Tiger lawn bowls, it is clear that there are significant differences. The Taylor Ace can be purchased new for £360 or second-hand for around £160-£230. In contrast, the Henselite Tiger brand new costs around £400, with the Tiger II available second hand for anywhere between £200-£690.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Taylor Ace may initially seem like the more affordable option, it is essential to consider the quality of the materials and manufacturing when making a purchase. The higher price point of the Henselite Tiger may reflect the company's commitment to producing a more durable and reliable product in the long run, whereas cheaper options may have a shorter lifespan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>If you play both indoors and outdoors, the Taylor Ace would be the best choice for you. This mid-biased bowl is suitable for all types of surfaces and is versatile enough to be used in a variety of conditions. However, if you only play outdoors, the Henselite Tiger would be a better option.
