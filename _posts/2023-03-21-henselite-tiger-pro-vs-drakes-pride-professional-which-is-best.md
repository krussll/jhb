<p>In this blog post, I'll be comparing two popular lawn bowl models - the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Drakes Pride Professional. We'll be looking at the spec of the bowls, their bias, grip options, price, and who each bowl will best suit. By the end of this guide, you'll feel more confident in choosing the right bowl for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2726} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro lawn bowl is a mid-biased bowl that is perfect for both indoor and outdoor play. It is the ideal choice for bowlers who play on different surfaces and is available in sizes 00 to 5, although it is only available for purchase in the UK. It is tough to find the Henselite Tiger Pro on online second-hand marketplaces, making it one of the more expensive bowls on the market. However, its top-quality construction and performance make it worth the investment.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride Professional is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor use on various surfaces and conditions. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 but only for the UK market. This versatile bowl can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger Pro and Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowls are mid-biased and suitable for indoor and outdoor play. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2798} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Their bias rating falls in between other popular models in their respective brand's line-up. The Tiger Pro is ideal for those who play all year round, while the Professional is suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the bias on both models is similar, and they have been designed to cater to a wide range of playing conditions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2809} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choosing between the two will mainly depend on personal preference and experience with the brand. Both Henselite and Drakes Pride have a reputation for producing high-quality lawn bowls, so you can't go wrong with either of these two models.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro and the Drakes Pride Professional are two popular models of lawn bowls with different grips. The Henselite Tiger Pro comes with the embedded Henselite Mega grip as standard, while the Drakes Pride Professional only offers a standard dimple grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand. This can be beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. On the other hand, the dimple grip is a classic style of grip with small divots running along the shoulder of the bowl. These dimples allow the fingertips to sit snugly inside, providing a better grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the two grips comes down to personal preference and the bowler's individual needs. The Henselite Tiger Pro may be a better option for those who require a deeper, more secure grip, while the Drakes Pride Professional may suit those who prefer a classic, slightly larger feeling bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to lawn bowls, the price difference between the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Drakes Pride Professional is noticeable. While the Tiger Pro costs around £400 brand new, the Professional is available for just £290. However, if you're in the market for second-hand bowls, you can find the Tiger Pro for around £250-£300 and the Professional for £60-£210.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's worth considering that the price of lawn bowls can vary depending on the size, weight, and material used for construction. The Tiger Pro and the Professional have different features, and it's important to take all of these into account when deciding which set of bowls to purchase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, both the Henselite Tiger Pro and Drakes Pride Professional are popular models of lawn bowls that offer a range of benefits to players. By comparing the cost of each, you can make an informed decision about which set is best suited to your needs and budget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are a player who participates in both indoor and outdoor games, the Henselite Tiger Pro may be the best fit for you. This dual-purpose bowl offers the flexibility to be played in any position within a team and performs well on various surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, if you're specifically looking for a mid-biased bowl that can be used on indoor and outdoor surfaces, the Drakes Pride Professional may be the way to go. It offers a consistent line and a comfortable grip, making it a great choice for players seeking accuracy and control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both bowls have their strengths and are suitable for different types of players. Ultimately, the choice comes down to personal preference and what feels most comfortable to the individual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After comparing the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowls, it's evident that both models are mid-biased and suitable for indoor and outdoor play. However, the Drakes Pride Professional stands out as a more versatile bowl that can adapt to a variety of surfaces and conditions. Additionally, it's more accessible and affordable as it can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger Pro is ideal for those who play on different surfaces but is limited in availability and is one of the most expensive bowls on the market. Ultimately, the choice between the two models comes down to personal preferences and the specific needs of the bowler.</p>
