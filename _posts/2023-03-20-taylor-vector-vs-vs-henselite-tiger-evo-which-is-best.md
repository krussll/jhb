<p>Throughout this guide, I'll be discussing the various specs of these bowls, including their bias and grip options, as well as their price points and which type of bowler they might be best suited for.

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a narrow biased lawn bowl that is designed for both indoor and fast outdoor play. It is particularly suited to indoor bowlers and those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. This model comes in sizes 00 to 5, however, it is only available in the UK market. If you are looking to purchase this bowl, you can find it on second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl that is perfect for outdoor play. It is a versatile bowl that is suitable for use on different surfaces and conditions. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market. However, it can be difficult to find the bowl on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay, and buyers may need to purchase new ones. Overall, the Henselite Tiger EVO is a reliable and flexible lawn bowl that is worth considering.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of bias, the Taylor Vector VS lawn bowl is narrower than the Henselite Tiger EVO. The Vector VS is designed for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens and is suitable for indoor and lead outdoor bowlers. On the other hand, the Tiger EVO is a midbiased to wide biased bowl that is ideal for all outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both bowls have their strengths, the Vector VS may be better for those who prefer a narrower and more precise bias, while the Tiger EVO may be better for those who want a wider bias for more versatility on different outdoor surfaces. Ultimately, the choice between the two depends on the individual's playing style and preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO and the Taylor Vector VS have different types of grips. The Taylor Vector VS uses a dimple grip called the Progrip, while the Henselite Tiger EVO comes with the Henselite Mega grip, an embedded grip that sits deeper into the bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Embedded grips can be beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly, as they make the bowl feel smaller in their hand. However, dimple grips like the Progrip provide a classic style of grip where your fingertips sit in dimples on the shoulder of the bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both grips have their advantages and disadvantages, ultimately it comes down to personal preference and what feels most comfortable for the individual bowler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to pricing, both the Taylor Vector VS and Henselite Tiger EVO lawn bowls are on the higher end. The Taylor Vector VS can be bought brand new for £360, which is slightly cheaper than the Henselite Tiger EVO's £400 price tag. However, if you're open to buying secondhand, the Taylor Vector VS can be found for an even more affordable £160-£190, whereas the Henselite Tiger EVO will still set you back £250-£300.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the Taylor Vector VS is the more budget-friendly option, whether bought new or secondhand. However, it's worth noting that the Henselite Tiger EVO may offer more value for money in terms of durability and performance. Ultimately, the price difference may come down to personal preferences and priorities when it comes to lawn bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS and Henselite Tiger EVO are two popular lawn bowls that cater to different preferences. The Taylor Vector VS is suitable for indoor bowlers who primarily play lead, while the Henselite Tiger EVO is targeted towards outdoor bowlers but can be played on all surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The narrow bias of the Taylor Vector VS makes it easier to target the jack accurately and control the shot. This feature is particularly favorable for lead bowlers who are responsible for setting up their team's shots. On the other hand, the mid-bias in the Henselite Tiger EVO makes it more versatile and suitable for various outdoor conditions. Its wider bias allows for more dynamic shots, making it ideal for players who prefer a more aggressive style of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, the Taylor Vector VS and Henselite Tiger EVO are both high-quality lawn bowls but cater to different requirements. If you primarily play indoor bowls and lead, then the Taylor Vector VS is an excellent choice. However, if you like playing outdoors and in various conditions, the Henselite Tiger EVO is a more versatile bowl. Ultimately, the best choice between the two would depend on individual preferences and playing style.</p>

The Taylor Vector VS is best suited for indoor play and fast outdoor greens, while the Henselite Tiger EVO is a more versatile bowl that can be used on various surfaces and conditions.
