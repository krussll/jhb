<p>Throughout this guide, I'll delve into the specifications, bias, grip options, and price of each type. And ultimately, I hope to help you determine which bowl will suit your needs best. So, let's dive in!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2723} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a versatile lawn bowl with a mid-to-wide bias that is perfect for outdoor play. It can be used on various surfaces and is available in 00 to 5 sizes for the UK market. However, purchasing it second-hand may prove to be a challenge as it is not commonly found online, making buying new the best option.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger lawn bowl is a wide-biased model designed for outdoor play. It is suitable for all types of outdoor surfaces and particularly well-suited to skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market, the Henselite Tiger is a great option for those who prefer wider-biased lawn bowls. While it may be difficult to find the Henselite Tiger on online second-hand marketplaces, purchasing a new set is a reliable way to achieve top-notch performance on the green.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger and the Henselite Tiger EVO are designed for outdoor greens and are suitable for all outdoor surfaces. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2838} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, their bias differs slightly. The Tiger EVO is a midbiased/wide biased bowl and is placed between the Tiger Pro and the Tiger in the Henselite range. The Tiger, on the other hand, is a wide biased bowl and is the widest bowl in the Henselite range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to its slightly lesser bias, the Tiger EVO may be a better choice for certain bowlers who prefer a midbiased/wide biased bowl. However, both bowls are ideal for outdoor greens and offer consistent performance. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2828} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It should be noted that the Tiger should be avoided if the bowler plays predominantly indoors. Overall, the choice between the two would depend on the bowler's personal preferences and playing style on outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Henselite Tiger come with the same embedded grip, the Henselite Mega grip, as standard. This type of grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand. This is beneficial for bowlers who struggle with grip, as it allows for a more secure hold on the bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, some bowls feature a classic dimple grip where small divots run along the shoulder of the bowl. This design allows for your fingertips to sit in the dimples, providing an enhanced grip. However, neither the Henselite Tiger EVO nor the Henselite Tiger feature a dimple grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the grip of the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Henselite Tiger are similar due to their shared use of the Henselite Mega embedded grip. However, if a bowler prefers the feel of a dimple grip, these models may not be the best fit for them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Henselite Tiger are premium models of lawn bowls with expensive price tags. The Henselite Tiger EVO is slightly more expensive than the Henselite Tiger, with a brand new set costing around £400. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger also costs about £400 brand new, but its second-hand versions can be found within the price range of £200-£690 depending on the model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Tiger EVO and the Tiger are pricey models, but the Tiger offers more affordability with available second-hand options. However, it's important to note that the specific cost of either model can fluctuate depending on the individual seller, condition of the bowls, and other factors, so it's always best to shop around and compare prices before making a purchase.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Henselite Tiger are popular models of lawn bowls, but they have some key differences that make them suitable for different players. The Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-biased bowl that is ideal for outdoor play, but can also be used on other surfaces. This makes it a versatile option for players who prefer to play on different types of greens. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger is a wide biased bowl that is meant for outdoor use only. If you play indoors, this bowl may not be the best choice for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Henselite Tiger EVO would be a great choice for players who want a bowl that can be used in different environments. It offers a good balance of bias and versatility, making it a reliable option for most players. On the other hand, if you primarily play outdoors and are looking for a bowl with a wider bias, the Henselite Tiger would be the better choice. It's important to consider your playing preferences and needs when choosing a lawn bowl, and both the Henselite Tiger EVO and Henselite Tiger are excellent options for different types of players.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Henselite Tiger are excellent choices for outdoor lawn bowls play. They both have wide biases that make them ideal for outdoor surfaces, and they are available in the same sizes. However, the Tiger EVO is a more versatile bowl that can be used on a variety of conditions, whereas the Tiger is better suited for skips. Both bowls are difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces and realistically need to be purchased new. Ultimately, the choice between the two models will depend on the player's specific preferences and needs.</p>
