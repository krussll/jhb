<h2>What are the balls called in lawn bowls?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In lawn bowls the balls are called "bowls" or "woods".</strong> "Woods" is reference to the fact they used to be made out of wood, however the more common term these days is "bowls".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href="#what-are-bowls-made-of"></a>What are bowls made of?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lawn bowls were originally made of wood, but are now made with composite plastic.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This not only makes the bowls last longer, but also allows for manufacturers to make the bowls to the same specification each and every time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href="#why-do-lawn-bowls-curve"></a>Why do lawn bowls curve?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lawn bowls are not perfectly round - at least not to the naked eye. One side will be slightly bigger than the other, this is known as the “bias”.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's the extra weight on one side of the bowl that generates the curve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Different models will have different biases, the bigger the bias the more the bowl will curve. This allows a bowler to select a bowl that generates the curve they need.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href="#do-bowls-expire"></a>Do bowls expire?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>No, bowls do not have an expiry date. As long as there is no visible damage they should be fine to use regardless of age.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowls do need to be “stamped” every couple of years if you want to compete at a high level. The stamp shows the bowls have been tested to a high standard and can be used in competitive games.</p>

<h2><a href="#how-long-do-lawn-bowls-last"></a>How long do lawn bowls last?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lawn bowls, if cared for correctly, can last 20-30 years - if not longer. Lawn bowls can be put through a process called "stamping", which is a series of tests and repairs. You can see when a bowl was last "stamped" by looking at the markings on the bowl.</strong></p>

<h2><a href="#can-you-play-lawn-bowls-in-the-rain"></a>Can you play lawn bowls in the rain?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Yes, you can play lawn bowls in light rain. However, in heavier rain you will have to stop to protect the green. According to Bowls Australia play can continue "If it begins to rain, play will continue until the Competition Manager deems it unsafe to do so or the greens become unplayable."
