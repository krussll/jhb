<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2726} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play, making it ideal for bowlers who play on a range of surfaces. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for UK markets only, these bowls are quite expensive and difficult to find second-hand online. Nevertheless, they are an excellent investment for serious bowlers who value quality and performance.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. Its versatility allows it to be used on various surfaces and conditions. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. It can also be purchased second-hand through online marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 are mid-biased lawn bowls, making them suitable for indoor and outdoor play. The Henselite Tiger Pro is positioned between the Tiger and Tiger II models and is ideal for bowlers who play year-round. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Its bias is geared more towards a draw shot, making it a great choice for indoor rinks. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 has the same bias as the popular Professional bowl but with a deeper grip. The bowl is situated in between the D-TEC and the XP models, making it a fantastic all-rounder. It is well-suited for both indoor and outdoor play, making it an excellent choice for bowlers who play in a variety of environments. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2796} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, depending on the bowler's preferences and playstyle, both bowls have their unique advantages in bias and suitability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offer embedded grip options. This means that the grip is set deeper into the bowl, which can be beneficial for bowlers who struggle with grip. However, the Henselite Tiger Pro comes with the Heneslite Mega grip as standard, whereas the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offers an embedded grip option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to embedded grips, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 also offers a classic dimple grip. This grip style features small divots along the shoulder of the bowl, which allows for better grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both models offer effective grip options for bowlers, but the Henselite Tiger Pro's embedded Heneslite Mega grip may be more appealing for those looking for a standard embedded option. Meanwhile, the Drakes Pride PRO-50's inclusion of a dimple grip may appeal to those looking for a more traditional grip style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Henselite Tiger Pro lawn bowl is on the higher end, costing around £400 for a brand new set. However, it is possible to find second-hand sets for a slightly discounted price at around £250-£300. In comparison, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 is more affordable, with a brand new set costing around £300 and second-hand sets priced at £190-£260.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 is a more budget-friendly option for those looking for a high-quality lawn bowl. However, it's important to note that the Henselite Tiger Pro may offer slightly better performance due to its higher price point and reputation among professional bowlers. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on individual preferences and priorities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowls are versatile options for bowls players. The Tiger Pro is a dual purpose bowl that can be used for both indoor and outdoor play, with flexibility for different positions in a team. On the other hand, the PRO-50 from Drakes Pride is a mid-biased bowl that works well on a variety of surfaces for both indoor and outdoor games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choosing between these two models will largely depend on a player's preferences and skill level. The Tiger Pro is a good option for those who want a versatile bowl that can adapt to different conditions and roles within a team. The PRO-50, meanwhile, is a strong choice for players who want a dependable, mid-biased bowl that can perform consistently on various surfaces. Ultimately, both the Henselite and Drakes Pride bowls have their own unique strengths and would be suitable for different types of players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 are excellent options for lawn bowlers seeking a mid-biased bowl that can be used both indoors and outdoors. However, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offers greater versatility by being able to handle a wider variety of surface and conditions. Additionally, it is more readily available on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay. While the Henselite Tiger Pro is a quality bowl, its high price point and limited availability in the second-hand market may make the Drakes Pride PRO-50 a more practical choice for many bowlers.</p>
