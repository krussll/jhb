<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a narrow biased lawn bowl designed for indoor and fast outdoor play. It is ideal for lead bowlers who prefer a smaller bowl, and it comes in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. As it's one of Taylor's older models, it can sometimes be found on online second-hand marketplaces.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC is a bowl designed for indoor play, with a narrow bias that suits fast outdoor greens as well. Available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market, it may not be easy to find on online second-hand marketplaces. Overall, it is a great choice for indoor bowlers and those who play lead on fast outdoor greens.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both The Drakes Pride D-TEC and the Taylor Vector VS are narrow biased lawn bowls suitable for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. The Vector VS is slightly wider in bias than the D-TEC, falling between the Lazer and the Blaze in the Taylor range. While both bowls are suitable for indoor bowlers, the D-TEC is not recommended for those who predominantly play outdoor greens in the UK due to its narrow bias. Overall, both are great options for those looking for a narrow biased lawn bowl.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of Taylor Vector VS and Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowls, there are some key differences to consider. The Taylor Vector VS comes with the Taylor Progrip, which is a reliable and effective dimple grip. However, it does not offer the option of an embedded grip. In contrast, the Drakes Pride D-TEC only offers a standard dimple grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making the bowl feel smaller in your hand. This can be beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. On the other hand, a classic dimple grip offers small divots along the shoulder of the bowl, allowing your fingertips to sit within these dimples and providing a better grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between these two models may come down to personal preference and individual bowler needs. While the Taylor Progrip is a reliable option, the option for an embedded grip may be more ideal for those who struggle with grip. Ultimately, it is important for bowlers to try out different grip styles to determine which is most comfortable and effective for their individual technique.</p>

The Taylor Vector VS is priced higher than the Drakes Pride D-TEC, with a new Taylor Vector VS costing around £360, whereas a new Drakes Pride D-TEC is about £70 cheaper, priced at around £290.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's worth noting that both the Taylor Vector VS and the Drakes Pride D-TEC are high-quality lawn bowls with unique features, and that ultimately, the decision to go for one over the other largely comes down to a player's personal preference and playing style. While the Taylor Vector VS may be a more expensive option, it offers excellent control and precision on the green, making it a popular choice amongst experienced bowlers.

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on the descriptions above, it appears that the Taylor Vector VS and the Drakes Pride D-TEC are very similar in terms of their intended use and bias. Therefore, the decision between the two may come down to personal preference and playing style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That being said, the Taylor Vector VS may be better suited for players who primarily play indoors, as it is marketed as an indoor bowl. Furthermore, its narrow bias may make it easier to play as a lead, which is a position that requires accuracy and consistency in delivery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride D-TEC may be a better choice for players who prefer a slightly heavier bowl, as it is available in weights up to size 5. Its narrow bias also makes it suitable for playing as a lead, but it may also work well for players in other positions who rely on accuracy in their shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between the Taylor Vector VS and the Drakes Pride D-TEC will depend on a range of factors, including the individual player's style and preference, as well as the conditions in which the bowls will be used. Both are high-quality options that can offer reliable performance for experienced bowlers.</p>
