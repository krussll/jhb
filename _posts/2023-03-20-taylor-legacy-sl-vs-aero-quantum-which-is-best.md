<p>We'll go over the specs, bias, grip options, price, and who each bowl is best suited for. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clearer idea of which bowl is the perfect fit for you. Let's dive in!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL is a wide biased bowl designed for outdoor play. It is ideal for all outdoor surfaces and is particularly suited to skips. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5, but is only available in the UK market. It can also be found on online second hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum is a narrow bias lawn bowl designed for indoor and fast outdoor play. It's ideal for players who lead on fast outdoor greens or primarily play indoors. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, the Aero Quantum can be challenging to find on second-hand marketplaces like eBay. New purchases are more likely necessary.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum and Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowls have varying biases, suited for different playing conditions. The Taylor Legacy SL's wide bias makes it ideal for outdoor greens and all outdoor surfaces, but may not be suitable for indoor play. On the other hand, the Aero Quantum's narrow bias makes it perfect for indoor rinks as well as outdoor greens, and is suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While bias may play a significant role in choosing the perfect lawn bowl, it is important to consider various factors such as playing style, green conditions, and personal preferences to ensure the best fit. Ultimately, choosing the right lawn bowl comes down to finding the perfect balance between bias and other essential factors.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum offers more options for grips than the Taylor Legacy SL. All grips come as standard and cost nothing extra. You can choose from a dimple, embedded, or non-gripped option. On the other hand, the Taylor Legacy SL only comes with the Taylor Progrip, a dimple grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Taylor Progrip is one of the best dimple grips, an embedded grip is considered to be better. This is because an embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl which makes it feel smaller in your hand. This is ideal for bowlers who have problems gripping the bowl properly. If you prefer an embedded grip, the Aero Quantum could be a better option for you as it offers this option along with the other two.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Aero Quantum lawn bowl is definitely on the higher end compared to the Taylor Legacy SL. While both can be bought second hand at a cheaper price, the Aero Quantum still has a higher second hand cost. When buying new, the difference in price is even more apparent with the Aero Quantum costing around Â£110 more than the Taylor Legacy SL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it's important to note that price isn't the only factor to consider when choosing between these two models. Factors such as grip, weight, and bias should also be taken into account when making a decision. Additionally, personal preference and playing style may also affect which lawn bowl is the better choice for you. Ultimately, it's important to weigh all of these factors and make an informed decision based on your individual needs and preferences.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL is best suited for outdoor bowlers who prefer a wide biased bowl. This bowl is not suitable for indoor play, but is great for outdoor greens. The wide bias allows for accurate shot making and control on uneven or unpredictable outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Aero Quantum is a versatile bowl that can be used for both indoor and outdoor play. Its narrow bias makes it particularly useful for indoor play, where precision shots and controlled movement are crucial. It's also great for outdoor lead bowlers, who need a bowl that can hold a straight line and adapt to changing green conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between the Taylor Legacy SL and the Aero Quantum will depend on your preferences and needs as a bowler. If you primarily play outdoors and prefer a wide biased bowl, the Taylor Legacy SL is a great option. If you're looking for a bowl that can be used for both indoor and outdoor play and has a narrower bias, the Aero Quantum is a good choice.</p>

<p>In conclusion, both the Aero Quantum and the Taylor Legacy SL are popular models of lawn bowls, each with their own unique features and intended uses. The Taylor Legacy SL is well suited for outdoor play on all surfaces, while the Aero Quantum is best for indoor play or fast outdoor greens. Both bowls are available in a range of sizes for the UK market.
