<p>In this blog post, I'll be comparing two popular models - the Taylor Lignoid and the Henselite Tiger TX - so you can make an informed decision. Throughout the guide, we'll be looking at the spec of the bowls, the bias, the grip options, the price, and who each bowl is best suited for. By the end of this guide, you'll feel confident in choosing the perfect lawn bowl for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid is a wide biased lawn bowl that is perfect for outdoor play on all surfaces. It is particularly well-suited for skips and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. Although it may be difficult to find in stores, it can often be found on online second hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX is a sleek and narrow biased lawn bowl that is designed for indoor play. This model is particularly well-suited for skilled bowlers who play lead on fast outdoor greens. The UK market offers sizes ranging from 00 to 5, but the Henselite Tiger TX is not commonly found on second-hand marketplaces like eBay. Therefore, those interested in purchasing the Henselite Tiger TX should plan to buy them new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference in bias between the Henselite Tiger TX and the Taylor Lignoid is their width. The Tiger TX has a narrow bias, while the Lignoid is wide biased. This makes the Tiger TX ideal for indoor rinks and indoor bowlers, while the Lignoid is suited for outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the Lignoid is wider than any other bowl in the Taylor range, while the Tiger TX is the narrowest biased bowl in the Henselite range. The Legacy SL is a suitable alternative for outdoor surfaces if you primarily play indoors, while the Tiger TX should be avoided if you mainly play outdoors in the UK.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, the Lignoid and Tiger TX have different biases due to their respective widths, making them suitable for different environments and player preferences.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the grips of the Henselite Tiger TX lawn bowl and the Taylor Lignoid, it's important to note that while the Taylor Lignoid comes with the well-regarded Taylor Progrip, it doesn't offer the option of an embedded grip. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger TX features the Heneslite Mega grip which is an embedded grip set deeper into the bowl. This can provide a better grip for bowlers who struggle to hold onto the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the embedded grip of the Henselite Tiger TX may sound like the better option, it's worth noting that a dimple grip like the one found on the Taylor Lignoid is a classic style of grip that many feel provides a superior grip. The small divots or dimples in the shoulder of the bowl are designed to allow your fingertips to sit in the grip, which can help enhance your control of the bowl. Ultimately, the choice between an embedded grip and a dimple grip will come down to personal preference and what feels most comfortable for the bowler.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the price point, it's clear that the Taylor Lignoid is more affordable than the Henselite Tiger TX. Brand new, the Lignoid can be purchased for £290 while the Tiger TX comes in at £420. Second hand, the Lignoid is in the range of £90-130 while the Tiger TX is around £260-310.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Henselite Tiger TX is pricier, it does offer a range of features such as a bias closer to the jack and a sleek design. The Taylor Lignoid, on the other hand, has a reputation for being reliable and durable at a more accessible price point. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and budget when choosing between these two popular models of lawn bowls.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid and Henselite Tiger TX are both popular models of lawn bowls with different strengths and purposes. The wide biased Taylor Lignoid is suitable for outdoor players who require a bowl with a broad swing or curve to navigate uneven terrains. Conversely, the narrow biased Henselite Tiger TX is better suited for indoor players, particularly leads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When choosing between these two models, it is essential to consider your playing environment and position. The Taylor Lignoid's wider bias and larger size make it ideal for outdoor players who need more control, while the Henselite Tiger TX's narrow bias and smaller size allow for precision and maneuvering in indoor games. Ultimately, both models have their strengths and target audiences, and players should choose based on their needs.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, the Henselite Tiger TX and the Taylor Lignoid are both popular models of lawn bowls, but they are designed for different types of play. The Henselite Tiger TX is best for indoor play or fast outdoor greens, while the Taylor Lignoid is ideal for all outdoor surfaces and is suited to skips. Additionally, the Taylor Lignoid can be found on online second-hand marketplaces, while the Henselite Tiger TX is harder to come by and realistically needs to be purchased new.
