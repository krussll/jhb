<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl suitable for outdoor play. It is a versatile bowl that can be used on various surfaces and conditions. The bowl is only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and is difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces. Thus, new purchases may need to be considered.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Taylor International lawn bowls are described as midbiased/wide biased and are suitable for outdoor greens and surfaces. The main difference between these two bowls lies in their specific design and features. The Taylor International is positioned in the middle of the Taylor range, between the Ace and the Legacy, whereas the Henselite Tiger EVO is positioned between the Tiger Pro and the Tiger in the Henselite range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both bowls are suitable for experienced players who prefer midbiased/wide biased bowls. However, the specific characteristics of each bowl may appeal to different players depending on their individual playing style and preferences. It is important for players to try out different bowls and assess their bias in order to find the most suitable one for their needs.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International and Henselite Tiger EVO lawn bowls are both popular models that differ in their grip styles. The Taylor International features a dimple grip called the Progrip, while the Henselite Tiger EVO has an embedded grip called the Henselite Mega grip. While the Progrip is considered one of the best dimple grips available, an embedded grip is better for bowlers who struggle with grip. This is because the deeper set grip of the Henselite Mega allows the bowl to feel smaller in the bowler's hand, improving grip and accuracy. Overall, both grips have their advantages and it comes down to personal preference and individual needs when choosing between the two models.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the prices of the Taylor International and the Henselite Tiger EVO, it is clear that the Taylor International is the more budget-friendly option. With a new set priced at £360 and a second-hand set costing between £100-£190, the Taylor International is ideal for those who want to save money while still enjoying the sport of lawn bowls. Alternatively, the Henselite Tiger EVO is considered a more expensive option, with a brand new set costing around £400 and a second-hand set being sold for around £250-£300.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the price difference between the two models can be justified by considering the features that come with each set. The Henselite Tiger EVO is known for its advanced technology and superior grip, which can help enhance the player's performance on the green. The Taylor International, on the other hand, is a more traditional model that may appeal to those who prefer a classic design. Ultimately, the decision between the two models will come down to personal preference and budget, but it is important to remember that investing in a high-quality set of lawn bowls can be a worthwhile purchase for serious players.</p>
