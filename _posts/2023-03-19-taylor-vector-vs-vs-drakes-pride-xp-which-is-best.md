<p>In this blog post, I will be comparing two of the most popular lawn bowls - the Taylor Vector VS and the Drakes Pride XP. We'll be taking a close look at their specs, bias, grip options, and price, so you can make an informed decision about which bowl is right for you. By the end of this guide, I promise you'll have a better understanding of which bowl will suit your needs best. So, let's dive in!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a narrow biased bowl suitable for quick outdoor play and indoor use. It's particularly well suited for indoor bowlers and those who play lead on fast outdoor greens, providing excellent control and precision. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, the Taylor Vector VS can often be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride XP is a wide-biased bowl designed for outdoor play. It is highly versatile and suitable for use on all outdoor surfaces, making it ideal for skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5, this bowl is designed for the UK market and can be difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces. If you're looking for the ultimate outdoor lawn bowling experience, the Drakes Pride XP is a top choice.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The major difference between the bias of the Drakes Pride XP and the Taylor Vector VS lawn bowl is their width. The XP is a wide biased bowl, whereas the Vector VS is a narrow biased bowl. The XP is designed for use on outdoor greens, while the Vector VS is ideal for both indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is suitable for both indoor and lead outdoor bowlers, whereas the Drakes Pride XP is recommended for all outdoor surfaces. The Vector VS is placed between the Lazer and Blaze in the Taylor range, while the XP is the widest bowl in the Drakes Pride range. Overall, the bias of each bowl is optimized for specific conditions, and it is essential to choose the right bowl accordingly.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS comes with the Taylor Progrip as standard, which is considered one of the best dimple grips available. However, the model does not offer an embedded grip option, which can be preferable for bowlers who struggle with grip. In contrast, the Drakes Pride XP only comes with their standard dimple grip, but some bowlers may prefer the classic style of grip that the dimples provide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, which can make the bowl feel smaller in the hand and help with grip issues. On the other hand, a dimple grip provides small divots or dimples along the shoulder of the bowl, which allows the finger tips to sit in the dimples and improves grip. Ultimately, the choice between the grips of the Taylor Vector VS and the Drakes Pride XP will depend on the individual bowler's preferences and needs.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of price, there is a noticeable difference between the Taylor Vector VS and the Drakes Pride XP. The Taylor Vector VS is priced at £360 for new, while the Drakes Pride XP is a bit more affordable at around £290 for new. However, when it comes to buying secondhand, the price gap narrows down significantly. The Taylor Vector VS can be purchased secondhand for about £160-£190, whereas the Drakes Pride XP is slightly cheaper at a range of £140-£250.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is important to note that the price shouldn't be the only factor in choosing between the two models. The quality of the materials and design, as well as personal preference, should also be considered when making the decision. Both the Taylor Vector VS and the Drakes Pride XP are popular models of lawn bowls used by professional and amateur players alike. Ultimately, the best choice will depend on the individual's needs and budget.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS lawn bowl would best suit indoor bowlers who primarily play lead. Its narrow bias means that it can be used on faster outdoor surfaces, but it is targeted towards indoor play. Meanwhile, the Drakes Pride XP lawn bowl is designed for outdoor play, specifically for those who play solely outdoors. Its wide bias makes it unsuitable for indoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When considering which lawn bowl to choose, it is important to consider the type of playing surface and style of play. For indoor bowlers who play lead, the Taylor Vector VS is a good option, while those who play solely outdoors may prefer the Drakes Pride XP. Ultimately, personal preference will play a large role in selecting the right lawn bowl.</p>
