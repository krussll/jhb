<p>In this blog post, I'm going to compare two of the most popular models on the market: the Taylor International and the Aero GrooVe. We'll take a deep dive into the different specs, bias, grip options, and price points of each, so you can make an informed decision on which one is right for you. By the end of this guide, you'll feel confident in your ability to choose the perfect lawn bowl.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International is a popular lawn bowl model that is well-suited for outdoor play due to its mid-to-wide bias. Its versatility allows it to be used on various surfaces and conditions, making it a reliable option for lawn bowlers. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, the Taylor International can often be found on online second hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<p>The Aero GrooVe lawn bowl is a mid-biased bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play on a variety of surfaces and conditions. It is available in the UK market in sizes 00 to 5. While it may be difficult to find used Aero GrooVe bowls online, they can be purchased new for those in need of this versatile and high-quality lawn bowl.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International is a mid-biased/wide biased bowl, making it suitable for outdoor greens and all outdoor surfaces. It falls between the Ace and the Legacy in the Taylor range. On the other hand, the Aero GrooVe is also a mid-biased bowl but lies between the Quantum and the Sonic in the Aero range. The GrooVe is ideal for both indoor rinks and outdoor greens, suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowlers.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bias on a lawn bowl affects the curve and direction of the bowl as it travels towards the jack. With the Taylor International's wide bias, it will follow a wider curve towards the jack, whereas the Aero GrooVe's mid-bias will have a slightly narrower curve. Overall, both bowls are suitable for different bowlers and environments, and the choice between the two would be based on personal preference and the conditions of the playing surface.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of the Aero GrooVe and the Taylor International lawn bowls, it is clear that the Aero GrooVe offers more options. With their range including a dimple, embedded and non-gripped option, Aero provides a solution for every bowler's needs. In contrast, the Taylor International only comes with their Progrip, which is a dimple grip and is considered one of the best.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it's worth noting that an embedded grip is a better option for bowlers who struggle to grip the bowl properly. This is because the grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the hand. While the Taylor International doesn't offer this option, the Aero GrooVe does, making it a more versatile option for bowlers with grip issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while the Taylor International's Progrip is a tried and tested classic grip, the Aero GrooVe's range of grip options and ability to cater to a wider range of bowlers' needs makes it the more appealing choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the price comparison between these two popular lawn bowl models, it's quite clear that the Taylor International is the more budget-friendly option. While a new set of Taylor Internationals can be purchased for a relatively reasonable £360, the Aero GrooVe will cost you around £400 for a brand new set. Additionally, if you're on the hunt for a second-hand set, you can expect to pay a higher price for the Aero GrooVe than the Taylor International.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That being said, it's important to keep in mind that there are a number of factors that can impact the price of both of these models. For example, the specific size and weight of the bowls, as well as their condition, can all impact how much you can expect to pay. Additionally, some sellers may be willing to negotiate on price, so it's always worth checking around to see what kind of deals you can find. Ultimately, both the Taylor International and Aero GrooVe are high-quality lawn bowls that offer excellent performance and durability, so the decision really comes down to personal preference and budget.</p>
