<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Getting a set of bowls is the most expensive task you will have to undertake as a lawn bowler. So it's important you get the right set.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many bowlers spend most of their time focusing on the make and model to make sure the bias is right for them, but things get a little bit more complicated when you aren't sure what size and weight you need.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this guide I will be focusing on selecting the right weight of lawn bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Size and weight. Are they the same thing?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whilst lawn bowls do get heavier as the sizes increase, you can also get different weight options within the same size.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I like to consider this to be 2 separate decisions. First, you select the size of lawn bowl - you can see my guide on <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/what-size-lawn-bowl-should-i-use/" data-type="post" data-id="140">how to select the right size </a>for you - and then secondly you select the weight of the bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Size should always be your first choice, as nothing should prevent you from holding and delivering the bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What are the different weights?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are 2 different weights, medium and heavy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whilst its assumed that medium is the "normal" size, with heavy being the additional option - its actually the other way around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As standard lawn bowls are sold in a heavy weight, with medium being the lighter choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Which weight is best for you</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a rule of thumb, heavy is always the way to go. It is rare that you would want to go for a lighter bowl, as it is an advantage to have the heaviest bowl possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would only recommend a medium if you can comfortably hold a bowl, but struggle with holding your wrist in a comfortable position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pretty much all brands have dropped the medium option from new sets of bowls due to the lack of demand, however, you can get great <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/guide/second-hand-and-pre-loved-lawn-bowls/" data-type="post" data-id="379">quality medium bowls on second hand</a> marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to tell the weight of a bowl</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, you already have a set of bowls, or maybe you are looking at buying a second hand set - how do you know what weight that lawn bowl is?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The initial of the weight of a lawn bowl is stamped onto it alongside the size. In the example below you can see "3H". This shows this bowl is a size 3 heavy bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="/img/posts/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1282"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This stamp is located on the same size as the "World Bowls" stamp. You can find out more about <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/what-the-stamp-means-on-lawn-bowls/" data-type="post" data-id="242">what the stamp on a lawn bowl means</a> in my guide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a rule, you should always get a heavy weight bowl. So long as the bowl is the correct size, you shouldn't think any further than that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are unsure of the weight of a bowl, check the size stamp on the bowl.</p>
