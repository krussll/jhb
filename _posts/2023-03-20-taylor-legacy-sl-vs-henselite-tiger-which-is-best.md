<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide-biased lawn bowl that is perfect for outdoor play on any surface. It is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. This bowl is well-suited to skips and is highly sought after, which can make it difficult to find on online secondhand marketplaces. Those interested in the Henselite Tiger may need to purchase it new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger and the Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowls are wide biased and ideal for outdoor greens. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2811} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They are suitable for all outdoor surfaces but not recommended for indoor gameplay. The Legacy SL is a wider biased bowl in the Taylor range and is ideal for outdoor greens. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger is also a wide biased bowl in the Henselite range and is suitable for all outdoor surfaces. Although both bowls have some similarities, they differ in terms of the width of their bias. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2828} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, selecting the right lawn bowl depends on individual preference, playing style, and experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger comes with an embedded grip, called the Henselite Mega grip, which sits deeper into the bowl and makes it feel smaller in your hand. This can benefit bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. On the other hand, the Taylor Legacy SL comes with a dimple grip, the Taylor Progrip, which is one of the best around but does not offer the option of an embedded grip. Many bowlers prefer embedded grips over dimple grips, as they provide a more secure and comfortable grip. Therefore, the selection of an embedded or dimple grip is a personal preference for each bowler.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the price of the Taylor Legacy SL and the Henselite Tiger, it's evident that the former is considerably more affordable. A new Taylor Legacy SL can be bought for £290, while a new Henselite Tiger can cost around £400. Additionally, the Taylor Legacy SL can also be purchased second-hand for quite a bit less than either the new or used Henselite Tiger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the Henselite Tiger II, the prices can vary quite significantly, with used models ranging from £200 to £690. However, the Taylor Legacy SL remains more budget-friendly in this case as well. While the used Taylor Legacy SL can be purchased for around £100-£160, even the most affordable Henselite Tiger II options are still considerably more expensive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, if price is a significant factor in your decision, the Taylor Legacy SL is the clear winner in terms of affordability when compared to both the Henselite Tiger and the Henselite Tiger II.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Legacy SL and the Henselite Tiger are wide biased bowls that would be suitable for outdoor play. However, it is important to note that they are not suitable for indoor use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL is ideal for those who play solely outdoors and are looking for a bowl that has a wider bias than traditional models. Its wider bias allows for a larger arc when delivering the bowl, making it easier to play on outdoor greens that are often uneven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similarly, the Henselite Tiger is also a wide biased bowl that is designed for outdoor play. It is well-suited for bowlers who prefer a slightly faster game and for greens that are slightly faster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, both the Taylor Legacy SL and the Henselite Tiger are great options for outdoor bowlers who prefer a wide biased bowl. However, it is important to note that they are not suitable for indoor play. Ultimately, the choice between these two models will come down to personal preference and the playing conditions of the outdoor green.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Legacy SL and Henselite Tiger are ideal choices for outdoor lawn bowling with their wide bias and versatility on various surfaces. However, the availability of the two models differs as the Taylor Legacy SL can be found on online second hand marketplaces, while the Henselite Tiger is harder to come by unless purchased new. Ultimately, the choice between the two models will come down to personal preference and availability.</p>
