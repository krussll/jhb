<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International is a mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. Its versatile design allows it to be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions, making it a popular choice amongst players. The UK market offers sizes 00 to 5 for the Taylor International, and it can also be found on second-hand marketplaces like eBay. Overall, the Taylor International offers a reliable and adaptable option for lawn bowlers.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference in bias between the Taylor International and the Taylor Ace lawn bowls is that the International has a wider bias compared to the Ace, making it more suitable for outdoor greens. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2814} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Ace, on the other hand, is a mid-biased bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both bowls are mid-biased, the difference in bias can affect the trajectory of the bowl and the line it takes towards the jack. The wider bias of the International can make it slower and more stable, while the Ace's mid-bias can result in a slightly curvier trajectory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2824} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between the two depends on the bowler's personal preference and the type of surface they will be playing on. The International is a better pick for outdoor surfaces, while the Ace can be used for both indoor and outdoor bowling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of the Taylor Ace and Taylor International lawn bowls, it is clear that the Ace offers more options. It comes with a choice between the Progrip and Xtreme grip, both of which cater to different grip preferences. On the other hand, the International only comes with the Progrip as standard and does not offer an embedded grip option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip can be beneficial for bowlers who have trouble gripping the bowl properly as it can make the bowl feel smaller in their hand. Meanwhile, a dimple grip like the Progrip found on both models is a classic choice that provides small divots for the fingers to grip onto. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and what feels most comfortable for the individual bowler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the price of lawn bowls, there isn't much of a difference between the Taylor Ace and the Taylor International. Both can be purchased new for £360, and both have a wide range of prices on the second-hand market. The Taylor Ace may fetch a higher price at a second-hand store, with prices ranging from £160-£230, while the Taylor International can be found for as low as £100 and up to £190 depending on its condition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the price between these two models of lawn bowls is similar enough that it likely won't be the deciding factor in which one to choose. Instead, bowlers should consider factors such as weight, size, and bias when selecting their preferred model. With its narrower bias and smaller size, the Taylor Ace may be better suited for experienced bowlers who demand precision, while the Taylor International's wider bias may be ideal for beginners who need more forgiveness in their shots.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to lawn bowls, choosing the right model can greatly impact your game. The Taylor Ace and the Taylor International are two popular models that offer slightly different benefits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace is a mid-biased bowl that is ideal for both indoor and outdoor surfaces. This makes it a versatile option for players who like to switch up their playing environments. Additionally, its mid-bias allows for a reliable line and predictable turn, making it a good choice for players who prefer a more controlled game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Taylor International is also a mid-biased bowl, but it is specifically aimed at outdoor use. While it can be played on all surfaces, it excels in outdoor conditions due to its wider bias that allows for a more gradual arc. This makes it a great option for players who prioritize precision and finesse on outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Ace and the Taylor International have their respective strengths and weaknesses. The Ace’s versatility and reliability make it a solid choice for players of all experience levels and preferences, while the International’s focus on outdoor play makes it a great option for those who want to specialize in that environment.</p>

The Ace is a mid-biased bowl that can be used both indoors and outdoors, while the International is more suited for outdoor play with a mid-to-wide bias.
