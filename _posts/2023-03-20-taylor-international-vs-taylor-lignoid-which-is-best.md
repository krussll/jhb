<p>I'll be providing you with an in-depth comparison of the spec, bias, grip options, price, and the target audience for each type of bowl. You'll undoubtedly have a better understanding of which one is a better fit for you by the end of this guide. So, let's dive right in!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International is a popular lawn bowl that is suitable for outdoor play on a variety of surfaces and conditions. It has a mid-to-wide bias and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only. This versatile bowl is ideal for both beginners and experienced players and can be easily found on online secondhand marketplaces like eBay. Overall, the Taylor International is a great option for those looking for a reliable and adaptable lawn bowl.</p>

<p>The Taylor Lignoid is a wide biased lawn bowl that is perfect for outdoor play, particularly on all surfaces. It is well-suited for skips and is available in sizes 00 to 5, although currently only for the UK market. The Taylor Lignoid can also be purchased on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both lawn bowls from Taylor have a bias, which refers to the direction that the bowl veers off when rolled. The Taylor International has a midbiased/wide biased design while the Taylor Lignoid is a wide biased bowl. This means that the International will have a more controlled curve compared to the Lignoid. Moreover, the International is positioned between the Ace and the Legacy in the Taylor range, while the Lignoid is the widest bowl in the range.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both bowls are primarily designed for outdoor greens and are suitable for all outdoor surfaces. However, the Legacy SL should be avoided if you predominantly play indoors. Overall, the difference in bias between the two Taylor lawn bowls suggests that the International may be more suitable for players who prefer a slower, more consistent bowl. In contrast, the Lignoid may be better suited for those who prefer a more pronounced curve in their game.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor International and the Taylor Lignoid come with the same standard Taylor Progrip, which is a dimple grip and one of the best available. Neither bowl offers the option of an embedded grip, which is considered better than a dimple grip because it is set deeper into the bowl and can be helpful for bowlers with grip issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both bowls have the same grip, it is worth noting that the dimple grip is a classic style and designed to hold your fingers in the small divots along the shoulder of the bowl. Some bowlers may prefer this grip, while others may benefit from an embedded grip to help with their grip on the bowl. Ultimately, the choice between these two popular models will come down to personal preference and the needs of the individual bowler.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to choosing between the Taylor Lignoid and the Taylor International for your lawn bowls, price can be a deciding factor. The Taylor Lignoid is the more affordable option, with a new set costing £290 compared to the £360 for the Taylor International. However, if you're looking to purchase second hand, you can find a set of Taylor Internationals for as low as £100-£190, while the Taylor Lignoid can be found for around £90-£130.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the price difference may not be substantial, it's worth considering where the extra cost for the Taylor International is coming from. The Taylor International is made from a denser material and is designed to offer additional stability and consistency. The Taylor Lignoid, on the other hand, is made from a composite material that is designed to be more durable and weather-resistant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the two models will likely come down to personal preference and playing style. However, it's worth considering the differences in price and materials when making your decision. The Taylor International may offer enhanced performance, but the Taylor Lignoid may be a more practical choice for those looking for a weather-resistant option at a lower price point.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International and the Taylor Lignoid are two popular models of lawn bowls that cater to different needs. The Taylor International, with its mid-bias and versatility on all surfaces, is suitable for players who enjoy playing both indoors and outdoors. On the other hand, the Taylor Lignoid, with its wide bias and suitability only for outdoor surfaces, is best suited for players who mainly play outdoor lawn bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are a player who enjoys playing on various surfaces, the Taylor International would be the ideal choice. Its mid-bias makes it versatile enough to play on different rinks, which is perfect for players who compete in various competitions or like to mix up their playing surfaces. The Taylor Lignoid would be more suited for players who solely play on outdoor surfaces, as its wide bias may not work well on indoor rinks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, the choice between the Taylor International and the Taylor Lignoid depends on one's playing surface and preference. Both models have their unique attributes and cater to different types of players. Ultimately, it is essential to choose the lawn bowl that best suits your playing style to achieve the best results.</p>
