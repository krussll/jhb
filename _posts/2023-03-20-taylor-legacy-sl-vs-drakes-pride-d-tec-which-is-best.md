I'll be breaking down the specs, bias, grip options, and price of each bowl, so you can make an informed decision about which one is right for you. By the end of this guide, you'll have a better idea of which lawn bowl will be the perfect fit for your needs. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC is a narrow biased bowl designed for indoor play. It's ideal for indoor bowlers and those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, this bowl can be tricky to find on online secondhand marketplaces like eBay. For those interested in purchasing the Drakes Pride D-TEC, buying new may be the best option.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowl and the Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowl differ in their bias. The D-TEC has a narrow bias and is suitable for indoor play and fast outdoor greens, while the Legacy SL has a wide bias and is ideal for outdoor greens. The Legacy SL should be avoided for indoor play, whereas the D-TEC should be avoided for outdoor play in the UK.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Players who prefer a more controlled and precise shot may prefer using the D-TEC. Meanwhile, those who prefer a stronger curve towards the jack may find the Legacy SL more suitable. Ultimately, it's important to choose the right lawn bowl that suits your playing style, preferred playing conditions, and bowling goals.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grip options, the Taylor Legacy SL and Drakes Pride D-TEC have different approaches. The Taylor Legacy SL only offers the standard dimple grip, known as the Progrip. However, bowlers who prefer an embedded grip will miss out on this option. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride D-TEC also only offers a dimple grip, which is a classic style that many bowlers find effective.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One advantage of an embedded grip is that it sits deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand. This can benefit bowlers who struggle with gripping larger bowls. On the other hand, the dimple grip on both models provides a surface for your fingertips to rest on, which can help with grip and control. Ultimately, which grip option you prefer will come down to personal preference and what works best for your individual style of play.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to pricing, both the Taylor Legacy SL and the Drakes Pride D-TEC are similar. Both models can be bought new for approximately £290. However, when it comes to the second-hand market, there is a slight difference in price. The Taylor Legacy SL can be purchased for around £100-£160, while the Drakes Pride D-TEC is generally sold for around £120-£200.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the difference in price between the two models is relatively small, and both are considered high-end lawn bowls. It ultimately comes down to personal preference and which model suits your specific needs and playing style. Regardless of which model you choose, investing in a high-quality lawn bowl can dramatically improve your performance on the green.</p>
