<p>In this blog post, I'll be comparing two popular models of lawn bowls: the Drakes Pride D-TEC and the Drakes Pride XP. We'll look at specs, bias, grip options, price, and who these bowls are best suited for. By the end of this guide, you'll have a better idea of which bowl will work best for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC is a narrow biased lawn bowl designed for indoor play. It is ideal for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only and can be difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces. It is recommended to buy them new instead.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride XP is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play on a variety of surfaces. It is well-suited to skips and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. While it may be challenging to find second-hand versions of the XP online, it is readily available to be purchased new.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC has a narrow bias, making it ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. It is not recommended for outdoor play in the UK. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP has a wide bias, which makes it perfect for outdoor greens and suitable for all outdoor surfaces. The XP is the widest bowl in the Drakes Pride range.<br/>Overall, the D-TEC and XP have contrasting biases, with the former being narrow and the latter being wide. Bowlers need to consider the type of surface they'll be playing on to choose the right bowl for their needs. If it's an indoor rink or fast outdoor greens, the D-TEC may be a better option. But for outdoor greens, the XP may provide better results.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Drakes Pride D-TEC and XP lawn bowls come with a standard dimple grip. However, the D-TEC offers an embedded grip that is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand. This feature is beneficial for bowlers who struggle to grip the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the XP also features a classic dimple grip, where small divots (or dimples) run along the shoulder of the bowl. This grip style allows your fingertips to sit in the dimples, providing a better grip on the bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while both models offer a similar grip style, the embedded grip of the D-TEC may provide an advantage for bowlers who struggle to grip the bowl, while the classic dimple grip of the XP may be preferred by those who enjoy the traditional grip style of lawn bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of these two popular models of lawn bowls, the Drakes Pride XP and the Drakes Pride D-TEC, it's clear that they are sold at similar price points. Both can be purchased brand new for around £290.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, there is a slight difference in the resale value of these two models. The Drakes Pride D-TEC can be purchased second hand for a range of £120-200, while the XP can be found for around £140-250. This suggests that the D-TEC may have a slightly higher resale value, perhaps due to its popularity or durability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, both of these models are similar in price and offer similar features, so the decision between which to purchase may come down to personal preference or individual needs on the green.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are an indoor bowler who frequently plays as a lead, the Drakes Pride D-TEC would be an ideal choice for you. This narrow biased bowl is designed to perform exceptionally well on indoor surfaces but can work on some outdoor conditions. Its narrow bias allows it to move when played with a straight-on delivery, making it perfect for lead shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is an excellent choice for those who play exclusively outdoors. Its wider bias makes it suitable for outdoor surfaces, where it can hold its line even when played with a less precise delivery. However, if you frequently play indoors, this bowl should be avoided as it may not perform as well as the D-TEC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, selecting the right lawn bowl depends on your preferences and playing style. Whether you prefer a narrower or wider bias, play indoors or outdoors, the Drakes Pride D-TEC and XP both offer exceptional quality and performance for bowlers at all levels.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, when comparing the Drakes Pride D-TEC and the Drakes Pride XP, it ultimately comes down to personal preference and intended use. The D-TEC is suited for indoor play and is ideal for lead players on fast outdoor greens, whereas the XP is a wide biased bowl that is perfect for outdoor play and is well-suited for skips. Both bowls are only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and can be challenging to find second hand online. Ultimately, it's important to consider your playing needs and preferences when deciding which model to purchase.</p>
