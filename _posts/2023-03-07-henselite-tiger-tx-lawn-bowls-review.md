<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX is a model designed specially for indoor bowlers, which is quite rare, as the majority of bowls on sale target the crowded "mid biased" market.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So those who play purely indoors have a much smaller pool of models to choose from, especially if they prefer a narrower bias.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this guide I'll go through everything you need to know about the Tiger TX and whether or not they are a good fit for you and your game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="#line-analysis"></a>Line analysis</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you might expect, the Tiger TX is the narrowest bowl in the Henselite range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2835} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, just because the Tiger TX is designed for indoor surfaces, it doesn't mean it can't be used outdoors, however from Henselite's own recommendations they shouldn't be used on anything slower than a 16 second green.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This pretty much rules out the UK's greens, but could be ideal for an all round bowl in Australia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whilst it could be used on fast greens (16+ seconds), it's primary purpose is on the indoor surfaces. Like the majority of the Henselite range it offers a smooth and even draw trajectory, with no hooked finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This draw trajectory has been designed for those who like a narrow draw to the jack, and is ideal for frontend (i.e. "lead") bowlers. It is rare to have such a narrow biased bowl on indoor surfaces, which will<a href="#sizes-and-weights"></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sizes and Weights</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Henselite offers the Tiger TX in the full range of sizes (00 to 5), and is consistent with other brands in only selling their models in a "Heavy" weight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I personally prefer a Heavy weight bowl, and it is rare to find a bowl that is sold new today that is anything different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="#grips-and-colours"></a>Grips and colours</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The newest version of the Tiger TX now includes Henselite's Mega Grip and Ergo Fit profile as standard features. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This combination provides a comfortable feel when holding the bowl. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those unfamiliar with these features, the Mega Grip is an embedded grip that creates a small channel in the shoulder of the bowl. This makes the bowl feel slightly smaller in the hand while maintaining its weight. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, Henselite designs their bowls to have a slightly narrower profile, known as the Ergo Fit. This creates a smaller feel in the hand and provides better control. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Henselite offers their bowls in 5 standard colours, but also offers limited-time additional colour options.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bottom Line</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger TX are a great option if you bowl indoors, or on exceptionally fast outdoor greens and you want something a bit on the narrow side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The draw arch is consistent and predictable, making it ideal for lead bowlers and singles players. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are in the market for these, and you don't want to buy them new, then you may have to be patient, as the second hand market for the Tiger TX isn't great. The Tiger TX is a specialist bowl, and because of that there aren't many in circulation, which will inflate the second hand value of the ones that do come up for sale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to buy the Tiger TX new, then you'll find a range of customisation options, as well as the ability to get them with Henselite's new Mega Grip, which in my opinion is a huge improvement on a standard dimple grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Henselite is one of the most expensive brands on the market, however with the quality of the manufacturing, as well as the new features an options I think they are well worth the investment.</p>
