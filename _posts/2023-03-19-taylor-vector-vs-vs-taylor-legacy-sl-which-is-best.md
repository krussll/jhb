<h2>Specs</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a narrow bias lawn bowl, perfect for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. Suited for indoor bowlers and those playing lead in fast conditions, this model is available in sizes 00 to 5 (in the UK market) and can also be found on online second hand marketplaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL is a wide biased bowl designed for outdoor play, particularly suited for skips. It can be used on all outdoor surfaces and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only. Additionally, this model can be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the Taylor Legacy SL and the Taylor Vector VS is their bias. The Legacy SL has a wide bias while the Vector VS has a narrow bias. This means that the Legacy SL will have a larger arc when rolling while the Vector VS will have a more direct line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of usage, the Vector VS is ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens while the Legacy SL is better suited for outdoor greens. The Vector VS is also suitable for indoor and lead outdoor bowlers while the Legacy SL can be used on all outdoor surfaces but should be avoided for predominantly indoor use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the two bowls will depend on individual preference and the type of surface they will be played on. Those who prefer a more direct line may opt for the Vector VS while those who prefer a larger arc may go for the Legacy SL.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Vector VS and the Taylor Legacy SL come with the Taylor Progrip as standard, which is a dimple grip and considered one of the best in the market. While neither model offers an embedded grip as an option, this is generally considered a better option for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between these grips is that an embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the bowler's hand. This can be helpful for those who find it difficult to grip the bowl. On the other hand, the dimple grip is a classic style of grip where your fingertips rest in small divots or dimples along the bowl's shoulder, providing a better grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both grips are high-quality and provide good traction for bowlers. The choice between the two will come down to personal preference and the needs of the individual bowler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on the prices mentioned, it is clear that the Taylor Legacy SL is more affordable compared to the Taylor Vector VS. The new Taylor Legacy SL costs £70 less than the new Taylor Vector VS, while the second-hand Legacy SL costs around £60 less. This difference in cost may be considerable for bowlers on a budget or those who do not want to invest as much money in their equipment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it is also worth noting that the Taylor Vector VS has a significantly higher resale value, with second-hand options still being priced above the cost of a new Taylor Legacy SL. This could be an important factor for bowlers who plan on upgrading in the future and want to get a good return on their investment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the decision on which model to choose will depend on individual preferences, needs, and budget. While the Taylor Vector VS offers advanced features, the Taylor Legacy SL provides an affordable and reliable option for those starting out or looking for a more cost-effective choice.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Vector VS and Taylor Legacy SL are popular models of lawn bowls, but they are designed for different types of players. The Vector VS is best suited for indoor bowlers who primarily play as leads, as the narrow bias allows for precise accuracy and control. On the other hand, the Legacy SL is a wide biased bowl designed for outdoor play and is not suitable for indoor use. It is ideal for those who play on outdoor surfaces and need a bowl with a stable bias.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When choosing between the two models, consider your playing environment and role on the team. The Vector VS is excellent for indoor play and lead bowlers, while the Legacy SL is the go-to choice for outdoor players. It is essential to choose the right type of bowl that works for your playing style, as it can make a significant impact on your overall performance.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Legacy SL and the Taylor Vector VS are popular models of lawn bowls with specific advantages depending on the player's needs. While the Taylor Vector VS is ideal for indoor and fast outdoor play, the Taylor Legacy SL is better suited for outdoor surfaces and is perfect for skips. Both bowls can be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay, and are available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. Ultimately, the choice between the two models will depend on the player's style, preference and the type of surface they intend to play on.</p>
