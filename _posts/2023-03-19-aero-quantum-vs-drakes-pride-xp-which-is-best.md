<p>That's why in this post, I will be comparing two of the most popular models - the Aero Quantum and the Drakes Pride XP. I will be covering everything from their specs, bias, grip options, price, and who they're best suited for. By the end of this guide, you'll have a better understanding of which bowl fits your needs best.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Aero Quantum Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum is a narrow biased lawn bowl that excels in both indoor and fast outdoor play. It's popular among indoor bowlers and those who prefer to play lead on quick outdoor greens. This model is only available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market and can be difficult to find second-hand online. Therefore, it's recommended to purchase them new.</p>

<h2>Drakes Pride XP Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride XP is a wide biased lawn bowl that is perfect for outdoor play on all surfaces. It is highly suited for skips and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. It is relatively difficult to find the Drakes Pride XP on online secondhand marketplaces such as eBay, meaning you may need to purchase a brand new set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of the Drakes Pride XP and the Aero Quantum lawn bowls is their width. The XP is described as wide biased, while the Quantum is narrow biased, making them suited for different surfaces. The XP is ideal for outdoor greens and suitable for all outdoor surfaces, while the Quantum is suited for both indoor rinks and outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride XP's wide bias will help it maintain a wider line throughout its trajectory, making it ideal for outdoor greens with a lot of wind or varying grass lengths. On the other hand, the Aero Quantum's narrow bias allows it to turn to a greater degree and adjust its trajectory more easily, making it ideal for indoor rinks where the surface is even and consistent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between these two bowls will depend on the player's needs and the surface they will be playing on. The wide bias of the XP may be better suited for outdoor greens with more wind, while the Quantum's narrow bias may be more appropriate for indoor rinks or outdoor greens with shorter grass.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grip options, the Aero Quantum outshines the Drakes Pride XP. Aero offers multiple grip options, including a dimple, embedded, and non-gripped option, all at no extra cost. This variety allows bowlers to choose the grip that best suits their needs and playing style. In contrast, the Drakes Pride XP only comes with their standard dimple grip, limiting the grip options for players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notably, the Aero embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand. This is ideal for players who struggle with gripping the bowl properly, as it helps them get a secure hold on the bowl. On the other hand, the classic dimple grip of the Drakes Pride XP features small divots along the shoulder of the bowl. Fingertips fit into these dimples to enhance grip, making it a reliable choice for many bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, while both models offer effective grips, the Aero Quantum provides more options for players to customize their equipment. The embedded grip of the Aero is ideal for those with grip issues, while the Drakes Pride XP's dimple grip is tried-and-true for a classic feel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, there is a clear difference between the Aero Quantum and Drakes Pride XP lawn bowling models. The Aero Quantum is significantly higher in price, with a new set costing around £400 and a second-hand set ranging from £300-£360. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is much more affordable, with a new set costing around £290 and a second-hand set ranging from £140-£250.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Aero Quantum may be a more expensive option, it does offer features that may justify the higher price. The Quantum is a lightweight bowl made from a special material that is designed to offer greater control and accuracy. It also has a unique grip design that allows for a more consistent release, which can be particularly useful for experienced bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is a more affordable option that still offers high-quality performance. It is a more traditional option, made from a denser material that has been designed for a strong and consistent line. It is also suitable for bowlers of all skill levels, which may make it a more appealing choice for those who are just starting out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, it is clear that there is a significant difference in price between these two popular lawn bowl models. While the Aero Quantum may be a more expensive option, it does offer unique features that may be worth the investment. However, the Drakes Pride XP is still a high-quality option that provides great performance at a more affordable price point.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're a lead bowler looking for a versatile option for both indoor and outdoor play, the Aero Quantum is likely the best choice for you. This narrow biased bowl is designed for a variety of positions on an indoor team, but can also be used for leads when playing outside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, if you strictly play outdoors, the Drakes Pride XP may be the better option for you. With a wide bias, this bowl is specifically aimed at outdoor use and should be avoided if you frequently play indoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, your specific needs and preferences will play a big role in which of these two popular models of lawn bowls is the best fit for you. Take the time to consider what type of play you participate in most often (or plan to in the future), and choose the bowl that will help you perform at your best.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Drakes Pride XP and Aero Quantum lawn bowls are great options for bowlers, with different strengths depending on individual preferences and needs. The Aero Quantum is best suited for indoor and fast outdoor play, while the Drakes Pride XP is ideal for all outdoor surfaces and is suited to skips. Both models are available in a variety of sizes for the UK market only and are challenging to find on online second-hand marketplaces. Ultimately, the choice between these two models comes down to the player's individual playing style and preferences.</p>
