<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a narrow biased bowl designed for indoor play and fast outdoor conditions. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, the Taylor Vector VS can be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased lawn bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It has a versatile bias that makes it ideal for bowlers who play on different surfaces. Available in sizes 00 to 5, it is designed for UK markets only, and can be challenging to find on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. As one of the most high-end models, the Henselite Tiger Pro is also one of the most expensive bowls on the market.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger Pro are designed for different types of bowlers and playing conditions. The Vector VS is a narrow biased bowl that is designed for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. It is best suited for indoor bowlers and lead outdoor bowlers. On the other hand, the Tiger Pro is a mid-biased bowl that is suitable for all types of outdoor greens and is great for all-year-round play both indoors and outdoors. It is ideal for all levels of bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the two, the Tiger Pro has a wider range of use, catering to bowlers who play on various types of greens, while the Vector VS is best suited for a specific type of playing condition. The Tiger Pro also has a higher level of bias, making it easier to control the bowl’s delivery. However, the narrow bias of the Vector VS allows for a more predictable and accurate delivery in specific conditions. Ultimately, the preference between the two bowls will depend on the individual bowler’s style, preferences, and playing conditions.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Taylor Vector VS lawn bowls, one of the key differences lies in their grips. The Taylor Vector VS has the Taylor Progrip, a classic dimple grip that is recognized as one of the best in the market. However, the bowl doesn't come with an embedded grip option, which some bowlers might prefer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger Pro comes with the Henselite Mega grip as standard, which is an embedded grip. This means that the grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand. This can be advantageous for bowlers who have difficulty with grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while both grips have their advantages, the Henselite Tiger Pro's embedded grip may be more appealing to some bowlers. However, the Taylor Progrip remains an excellent option for those who prefer the classic dimple grip. Ultimately, it comes down to one's personal preference and playing style.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to buying lawn bowls, price is undoubtedly an important factor to consider. The Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger Pro are two popular models that are often compared. The Taylor Vector VS is generally more affordable than the Henselite Tiger Pro, with a price tag of £360 when bought new. Second-hand Taylor Vector VS bowls can be found at prices ranging from £160 to £190.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, a new set of Henselite Tiger Pro bowls will cost you around £400. While this is a higher price point than the Taylor Vector VS, the Henselite bowls are known for their high quality and durability. If you are able to find a set of second-hand Henselite Tiger Pro bowls, you can expect to pay around £250 to £300. Ultimately, the choice between the two models will come down to your personal preferences and budget.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a great option for players who mainly play indoor bowls, especially leads who need a narrow bias to suit their position. It can also be used on faster outdoor surfaces, but may not be as effective as it is indoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger Pro is a versatile option that can be used both indoors and outdoors. It is a dual purpose bowl that can be played by anyone and can be used in multiple positions in a team. This makes it a great option for players who enjoy switching between indoor and outdoor bowls or for those who play in different positions within their team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between the two depends on the individual player's preferences and playing style. Those who mainly play indoor bowls and need a narrow bias would benefit from the Taylor Vector VS, while those looking for a versatile bowl that can be played indoors and outdoors, regardless of position, would be better suited to the Henselite Tiger Pro.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Vector VS and the Henselite Tiger Pro have their own unique strengths and are suitable for different types of bowlers. The Taylor Vector VS is more ideal for indoor and fast outdoor play with its narrow bias, while the Henselite Tiger Pro's mid-bias makes it suitable for various outdoor surfaces as well. However, the Henselite Tiger Pro is harder to find and more expensive than the Taylor Vector VS. Ultimately, the choice between these two popular lawn bowls will depend on personal preferences and playing style.</p>
