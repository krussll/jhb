<p>In this blog post, I'm going to be comparing two popular models of lawn bowls - the Taylor Ace and the Drakes Pride D-TEC - so you can make an informed decision. We'll be looking at everything from the specs to the price, and by the end of this guide, you'll know exactly which bowl is the perfect fit for you. Let's dive in!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2690} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace is a mid-biased lawn bowl that works well for indoor and outdoor play. It is a versatile model that can be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions, making it a great choice for experienced bowlers. The Taylor Ace is only available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market, and can sometimes be found on online second hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC model is a great choice for those who prefer narrow biased bowls, particularly for indoor play. This bowl is ideal for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, and can be trickier to find on online second hand marketplaces such as eBay. If you're interested in purchasing this bowl, it may be best to buy them new instead.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference in bias between the Taylor Ace and the Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowl is their level of bias. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2814} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Ace is a mid-biased bowl, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. The D-TEC, on the other hand, is a narrow biased bowl, making it ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens, but not recommended for outdoor play in the UK.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Ace is a solid choice for bowlers who want a balance between indoor and outdoor play, the D-TEC offers a specific advantage for those who play on fast outdoor greens or indoors. Bowlers who prioritize speed and precision will appreciate the D-TEC's narrow bias, which allows for accuracy in tight spaces. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Ace's mid-bias offers versatility for those who want to play on various surfaces. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on personal preference and playing conditions.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace and Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowls offer different grip options to suit bowlers' preferences. The Ace offers both the Progrip and Xtreme grip, while the D-TEC only has its standard dimple grip. The embedded Xtreme grip makes the bowl feel smaller in the hand, which can be beneficial for those struggling with grip, while the classic dimple grip of the D-TEC offers fingertip support for a secure hold. Ultimately, the choice between these popular models comes down to individual preference in grip style.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, it seems that the Taylor Ace is a more expensive option compared to the Drakes Pride D-TEC. Buying a new set of Taylor Aces would cost you around £360, while a new set of D-TECs would be priced at around £290, making the D-TECs a more budget-friendly option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if you are considering purchasing second-hand bowls, the prices would vary. A second-hand set of Taylor Aces could cost you around £160-£230, while a second-hand set of D-TECs could cost you around £120-£200. It is important to keep in mind that the prices of second-hand bowls differ depending on the condition they are in and the rarity of the specific model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, while the Taylor Ace may be considered more expensive than the D-TEC when buying new, both options have a range of prices when purchasing second-hand. It ultimately depends on personal preference and budget when choosing between these two popular models of lawn bowls.</p>
