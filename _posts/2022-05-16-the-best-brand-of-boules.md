<h2>The Biggest Brands</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a few brands of boule manufacturers that stand above the rest. There are four in particular that you should be looking for when you are seeking out a quality boule. While it would take a whole other piece to talk about the different avenues in which you could buy boules, it is important to focus on the brands instead.</p>

<h3>La Boule Obut</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is, without a doubt, the largest manufacturer of competition boules in the world. They have been around since 1955 and use fully-automated production machines to create their world-famous boules. They are so big that they control roughly 80% of the market share when it comes to competition boules.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They are also one of the largest companies in the world for petanque, employing roughly 130 workers and manufacturing more than 4 million boules per year. Though there are competitors emerging, they remain one of the largest names in the industry.</p>

<h3>La Boule Bleu</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Known as the “blue” ball from Marseille, the Rofritsch family has owned it since the company began to produce boules dating back to 1904. It has since become the last manufacturer located in Marseille, France.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>La Franc Boule</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Owned by FBT, a Thai sporting-goods manufacturer, these are arguably the most cost-effective boules on the market. There are some questions about the overall quality of the boules produced by FBT, but it is a great place for beginners to the game to grab boules that they can learn the game with.</p>

<h3>MS Petanque</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Different Types of Boules</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a few different types of boules. It helps to know this before making your choice as there are different styles and finishes available as a result. The most common boules available are competition and leisure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Leisure Boules</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are generally the less expensive option of the two as they are meant for either casual or occasional play. You may also hear them referred to as leisure, weekend, generic, recreational, or even DOG boules. The latter is one of the earliest models of Obut leisure boules.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leisure boules are typically only available in a singular size and weight. They also tend to come with a standard bright chrome finish. These boules are made with a thinner steel than you would find in competition boules and are usually fitted with dirt or sand in order to bring them up to the preferred weight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Competition Boules</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This type of boule is designed with the most serious of players in mind. These are also boules that have been certified by the International Petanque Federation (FIPJP) to be used in sanctioned tournaments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Competition boules must meet certain requirements and standards. They are also always hollow, but range in a wide array of weights, sizes, hardness, and even striation patterns. These boules are also carefully machined so that they are consistent in weight, size, and balance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is also worth noting that competition boules are also much more expensive than leisure boules. When starting out, using leisure boules is a better idea because it will cost substantially less as you get to learn the ins and outs of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With time and practice, you can upgrade your boules to a more competitive set. You can expect a set of three competition boules to run anywhere from $100 to several hundred depending on what option you go with. There are also junior options for competitive junior players who can’t use full-size boules.</p>
