<p>That's why I'm here to help! Let me tell you all about two popular lawn bowl models: the Taylor Blaze and the Aero Quantum. In this guide, I will be comparing their specs, bias, grip options, price, and who they are best suited for. By the end of this post, I'm confident that you will have a clearer idea of which lawn bowl is the perfect fit for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze is a mid-biased lawn bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play, making it a versatile option for bowlers. It can be used on a range of surfaces and in various conditions, making it an adaptable choice. The Taylor Blaze is available in sizes 00 to 5 but is only sold on the UK market, although it can also be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum is a narrow biased lawn bowl that is perfect for fast outdoor play or indoor use. It is an ideal choice for lead players who need precision and accuracy in their shots. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, the Aero Quantum is not commonly found on online second hand marketplaces, so buying new is the best option.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference in bias between the Taylor Blaze and the Aero Quantum lawn bowls is that the Blaze has a mid-bias while the Quantum has a narrow biased. The Blaze sits between the Vector VS and the Ace in the Taylor range, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. On the other hand, the Quantum is the narrowest bowl in the Aero range, again ideal for indoor and outdoor use.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Blaze has a slightly more balanced bias, the Quantum's narrow bias allows for precision placement and control in high-pressure situations. Both bowls are suitable for indoor and outdoor play, making them versatile options for all bowlers. Ultimately, the choice between the Blaze and the Quantum will depend on individual playing style and preference.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum offers a wider range of grip options than the Taylor Blaze, including a dimple grip, embedded grip, and non-gripped option. All grips come as standard and cost nothing extra, which is unique compared to other brands. The embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand, which benefits bowlers who have difficulty gripping the bowl. On the other hand, the Taylor Blaze comes with the Taylor Premier grip as standard, which is similar to the Taylor Progrip, but with oblong dimples instead of circular ones. The Taylor Blaze does not offer an embedded grip as an option. In general, the Aero Quantum provides more variety and customization in terms of grips.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Aero Quantum is generally more expensive than the Taylor Blaze. Buying a new set of Aero Quantum lawn bowls can cost around £400, while the Taylor Blaze can be purchased new for £360. However, if you're in the market for second-hand options, the Taylor Blaze may be the better choice as it can be found for around £210-£230, while a used set of Aero Quantum's can cost around £300-£360. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and budget when deciding between these popular models of lawn bowls.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Blaze and the Aero Quantum are popular models of lawn bowls, but they have different characteristics that suit different types of players. The Taylor Blaze is a mid-biased bowl that is ideal for playing on both indoor and outdoor surfaces. It can be used by players of different positions and levels of experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Aero Quantum is a narrow-biased bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It offers greater precision when playing with a team indoors and will best suit lead bowlers when used outdoors. Its unique design allows players to aim with greater accuracy and control their weight when releasing the bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, the Taylor Blaze offers versatility while the Aero Quantum has greater precision. The Taylor Blaze could be the right choice for players who play in a variety of conditions, while the Aero Quantum could be a great option for those who want to improve their accuracy and play in a team indoors.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After comparing the two popular models of lawn bowls, the Taylor Blaze and the Aero Quantum, it is clear that both have their own strengths and ideal playing conditions. The Taylor Blaze is a versatile mid-biased bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play on a variety of surfaces and conditions. Meanwhile, the Aero Quantum is a narrow biased bowl best for indoor players or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens.
