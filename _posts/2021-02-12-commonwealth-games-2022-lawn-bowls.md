<p>Lawn bowls have been included since it’s inception in 1930. In this guide, I’ll be taking a deep dive into the lawn bowls events in Birmingham. We’ll be looking at where the events will be played, how they will be played and who will be taking part.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of the <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/lawn-bowls-rules/">lawn bowls events will be played</a> at Leamington Spa’s Victoria Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Located around 45 minutes outside Birmingham city centre, Victoria Park will be outside of the rest of the Commonwealth locations - however, this green is one of the best in the country so it’s easy to see why it was chosen over other bowls clubs in Birmingham.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Victoria Park bowling club is regarded as one of the best greens in the country. The women’s and men’s national championships are held here every year, and the green is maintained to an international standard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ask any club player and Lemington Spa is held in the highest regard.</p>

<h2><a href="#tournament-format"></a>Tournament format</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Commonwealth events differ from most of the other major championships. Whereas most competitions are run in a straight knock-out format, the <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/lawn-bowls-at-the-commonwealth-games/">Commonwealth Games</a> have a group stage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Commonwealth bowls events start with a round-robin group stage with top 2 from each of the 4 groups progressing to a knock-out format consisting of quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gold and silver are given to the winner and loser of the final, and a bronze medal is decided with a Bronze medal match played by the two losing semi-finalists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will usually help the bigger countries as it allows for competitors to have a slow start, yet still, qualify for the later stages. It removes a lot of opportunities for significant upsets - but it does ensure the most consistent players are playing for medal honours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the restrictions on COVID and the chance that some teams may pull out of competing, we may find a slightly different format this time around.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are the most successful countries in Commonwealth history. Keep an eye out for the top 5 as these countries are known for sending strong teams to the Games, and will be in the hunt for most of the medals on offer!</p>
