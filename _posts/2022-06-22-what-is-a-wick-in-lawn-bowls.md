<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you see someone play a lucky shot you will often hear other bowlers calling it a "wick", but what is a wick? And how do you react to it - both when its in your favour, and when its not?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this guide I will cover everything you need to know about wicks, plus a few thing you probably didn't need to know!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What is a wick</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A "wick" is when a bowl takes a lucky deflection off of another bowl already in play. Often, before the wick the bowl will be travelling on the wrong line for the shot attempted. This lucky deflection turns a bad shot into a good one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A wick can be infuriating for the team who are on the opposing side, and they certainly aren't against the <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/lawn-bowls-rules/" data-type="post" data-id="304">rules of lawn bowls</a>, everyone gets lucky from time to time so its best to enjoy it whilst you have it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to emphasize the point that a shot is only a "wick" when the bowler bowling didn't intend to make contact with the bowl in play. It is perfectly fine to target a bowl in the head, and to attempt to hit it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Luck or judgement?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some bowlers will claim that a wick isn't lucky at all, and that good players find wicks because they are putting their shots into good areas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This may be true to a certain extent, especially if one person has an uncanny ability to get wicks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, wicks are just pure luck! Especially the extreme scenarios where the wick takes place far away from the jack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Etiquette</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawn bowls is a gentlemanly sport, and good etiquette should be followed. It is common practice to not celebrate when you get a good result from a wick - no matter how hard it is to hold it in!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is often a good exercise to remember times where you have been on the wrong end of a wick (I know I have had a fair few in my time!), and try to have some understanding for your opponent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It can be hard to not celebrate, and sometimes our emotions get the better of us, especially in close games where a good wick can make all the difference. If this does happen and you do let out a peep of a cheer, you should always apologise to your opponent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, if your opponent gets a lucky wick, its usually poor form to have a moan about it. If it happens it's important to move on and not let it get to you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luck will always come your way eventually, no matter how much you think the universe is against you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, a wick is a lucky deflection off of a bowl in play that leads to a positive result.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wicks come in many forms, from slight glances, to massive deflections that take a very wide bowl straight to the jack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As with every other aspect of bowls, proper etiquette should be observed. Be sure to not get disheartened by your opponent getting a slice of luck, and please try not to cheer when it happens to you!</p>
