<p>Throughout this guide, I will walk you through the specs, bias, grip options, and pricing of each bowl. By the end of this post, you'll be able to make an informed decision on which bowl is the perfect fit for you. Let's get right into it!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze lawn bowl is a mid-biased model designed for both indoor and outdoor use. Its versatility allows it to perform well on a variety of surfaces and conditions, making it a reliable choice for bowlers. The Blaze is available in sizes 00 to 5, though it is only sold in the UK market. It can also be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. Overall, the Taylor Blaze is a dependable option for those looking for a mid-biased lawn bowl.</p>

<p>The Taylor Ace is a versatile lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. With its mid-bias, it's capable of accommodating a variety of conditions, making it a popular choice among lawn bowlers. Available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market, the Taylor Ace can be found on online secondhand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Ace and Blaze have a mid-bias, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor greens. However, the Blaze falls between the Vector VS and the Ace in the Taylor range, while the Ace falls between the Blaze and the International bowl. This means that the Ace has a slightly stronger bias than the Blaze.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both bowls are suitable for various conditions, the slight difference in bias may make a noticeable difference for skilled bowlers. The Blaze may be preferred for those who want a mid-bias with a little less turn, while the Ace may be preferred for those who want a mid-bias with a slightly stronger turn. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on individual preference and gameplay style.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparing the grips of the Taylor Ace and the Taylor Blaze, it is clear that both options offer different advantages to bowlers. The Taylor Blaze comes with the Premier grip, which is oblong and similar to the Progrip. On the other hand, the Taylor Ace offers a choice between the Progrip and the Xtreme grip. The Progrip is a classic dimple grip, while the Xtreme grip is an embedded grip that sits deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowlers who have difficulty gripping the bowl properly may find the embedded grip of the Taylor Ace to be an advantage. Meanwhile, those who prefer a classic style of grip may prefer the dimple grip of the Taylor Blaze or the Progrip option of the Taylor Ace. Ultimately, both options cater to a range of bowlers with different grip preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, both the Taylor Blaze and the Taylor Ace lawn bowls come in at the same amount when bought brand new. However, if you're on a tighter budget and don't mind opting for a second-hand set of bowls, the Taylor Ace comes out as the more affordable option. You can find a used set for as low as £160, which is significantly cheaper than the lowest price you could find for a second-hand Taylor Blaze set (£210).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, price isn't the only factor to consider when choosing between the two models. The Taylor Blaze is known for its larger size and wider bias, which make it a great option for those who prefer a heavier bowl and a bigger grip area. On the other hand, the Taylor Ace is slightly smaller, making it a better fit for those with smaller hands or less grip strength. Its narrower bias also makes it ideal for draw shots and indoor play. Depending on your individual preferences and playing style, either set could be the better choice for you.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both the Taylor Blaze and the Taylor Ace are mid-biased lawn bowls suited for indoor and outdoor surfaces, they do have some slight differences. The Taylor Blaze is slightly more stable and would be better suited for a bowler who tends to play with a straighter delivery. On the other hand, the Taylor Ace has a slightly wider line and would be better suited for a bowler who plays with a more curved delivery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another factor to consider is grip. The Taylor Blaze has a dimpled grip while the Taylor Ace has a shark grip. This means that the Taylor Ace may be a better choice for bowlers with sweaty hands or those who prefer a more secure grip. Ultimately, it is important to consider your own individual style of play and personal preferences when deciding between these two popular models of lawn bowls.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, while there are subtle differences in design and aesthetics between the Taylor Ace and the Taylor Blaze lawn bowls, both are mid-biased and versatile for indoor and outdoor play on different surfaces and conditions. They are available in the same range of sizes and can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. Ultimately, the choice between the two will come down to personal preference and individual playing style. However, both models are trusted and reliable options for lawn bowls enthusiasts looking for quality equipment.</p>
