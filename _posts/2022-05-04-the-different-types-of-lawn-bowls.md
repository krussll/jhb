<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Working out what set of bowls to use can be confusing - do you want a narrow set? What surface will they work on? Grips and colours? The list goes on. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes we make things more complicated than it needs to be, and all we need is for someone to simplify the decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do bowls work across different formats? And are there different types of bowls? That's what we're looking at today!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Are there different types of bowls?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, there are 3 distinct types of bowls based on the game being played:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>crown green bowls</li><li>carpet bowls</li><li>and flat green bowls (used for outdoor bowls, indoor bowls and short mat bowls)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each type can't be used for the other, for example you can't use a set of crown green bowls for lawn bowls. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is important to understand what game you are planning on playing and getting a set designed for that sport.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Crown Green Bowls</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crown green bowls is a traditional British game played on a green with a raised crown in the centre. The game is similar to lawn bowls, but the green is smaller and the bowls are heavier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Much like flat green bowls, crown green bowls come in different sizes, but without the different colour and grip options. Crown green bowls are often ungripped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crown green bowls come with standardised biases, so you don't get different models as you would when selecting a set of flat green bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top brands of crown green bowls are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Drakes Pride</li><li>Thomas Taylor</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Carpet Bowls</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carpet bowls is a game similar to lawn bowls, but played on a carpeted surface. Carpet bowls are much smaller than crown green and flat green bowls and only come in one size and bias.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carpet bowls have very few colour options (usually black or brown), and come with no grips - this is mainly due to the fact that you don't need to grip a carpet bowl in the same way you would a flat green bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Flat Green Bowls</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Flat green bowls offer the most flexibility, both in the formats you can play, but also the options you have available in terms of sizes, colours and grips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A flat green bowl can be used for:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Indoor bowls</li><li>Outdoor bowls</li><li>Short mat bowls#</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Depending on the brand and model you get, you can get a bowl that is any colour and pattern under the sun, a variety of grips and biases are available to suit any format and playing style. Lets take a look at each.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Indoor</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Indoor bowls is played on a carpet surface, and is the same dimensions as an outdoor green.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The surface runs much faster than an outdoor green (at least in the UK!), so bowls for indoor bowls often have a weaker bias.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A strong biased bowl for slow outdoor greens, or shot mat bowls may be too wide to control for a club player, so the right model is essential.

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Outdoor</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The outdoor game is exactly the same as indoor, only its played on grass or a synthetic astro-turf.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Outdoor greens run much slower, so a stronger biased bowl is need to get a decent amount of turn off of the surface, this is because the friction from the grass is stronger than the carpet of an indoor surface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many players play indoor over the winter, and outdoors during the summer. As many can't afford to have 2 sets of bowls, it is common for players to have a single set of bowls that play well on both indoor and outdoor surfaces. These are known as "duel purpose bowls".</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Short mat</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Short mat is very different from indoor bowls, despite it also being played indoors on a carpet surface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the name suggests short mat bowls is played on a much smaller surface, however unlike carpet bowls, a full size bowl is used and any flat green model can be used to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Duel purpose bowls are also great for short mat games, this makes them the most diverse options for a club bowler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are 3 types of bowls, crown green bowls, carpet bowls, and flat green bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is important to understand the differences, and what each type of bowl is used for, as they are not interchangeable.</p>
