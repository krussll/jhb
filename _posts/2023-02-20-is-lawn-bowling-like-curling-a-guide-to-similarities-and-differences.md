<h2>What is Lawn Bowling</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawn bowling is a game of skill and strategy. It requires players to carefully plan their shots and strategize how to score the most points. The game is played with four bowls per person (eight bowls total). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each bowl is slightly curved and has a small circumference. The bowls are rolled towards the jack and the player who gets the closest bowl to the jack scores points. The players take turns rolling their bowls until all eight bowls have been rolled. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Points are then calculated based on the bowls closest to the jack. The player with the most points at the end wins the game.</p>
