<p>Together, we will examine the specs, bias, grip options, price, and who these bowls will work best for. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clearer idea of which bowl will work best for you. Let's dive in!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2690} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace is a mid-biased lawn bowl that can be used for both indoor and outdoor play on various surfaces and conditions. This versatile bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5 and can be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX is a narrow biased lawn bowl designed for indoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, these bowls are not easily found on second hand marketplaces and are usually purchased new. Overall, the Henselite Tiger TX is a great choice for those who value accuracy and precision in their gameplay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference in bias between the Henselite Tiger TX and the Taylor Ace lawn bowls is that the Ace is a mid-biased bowl, while the Tiger TX is a narrow biased bowl. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2814} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This means that the Ace will have a more even, predictable curve when rolled, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger TX, on the other hand, will have a sharper, more unpredictable curve outdoors due to its narrow bias, making it better suited for use on indoor rinks only.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2835} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, while both bowls are suitable for indoor players, the Tiger TX should be avoided by those who predominantly play outdoors in the UK, as it is not as well-suited for outdoor greens. </p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the grips of lawn bowls, there are key differences between the Henselite Tiger TX and the Taylor Ace. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace comes with a choice between the Progrip and the Xtreme grip, both designed to fit any bowler's preference. The Progrip features a dimple grip design, which promotes better grip with the small divots running along the shoulder of the bowl. On the other hand, the Xtreme grip is an embedded grip, which does not feature the classic divots but is set deeper into the bowl for optimal grip.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, the Henselite Tiger TX features the Henselite Mega grip, which is an embedded grip designed to help bowlers with gripping issues. This grip is also set deeper into the bowl, which can make it feel smaller in the bowler's hand. With these key differences in mind, bowlers can choose the grip that works best for them and their playing style. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Ace and the Henselite Tiger TX models offer a solid grip option for lawn bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Taylor Ace and Henselite Tiger TX lawn bowls are both on the higher end of the scale, but there are differences to note. The Taylor Ace is the cheaper option, with a new set priced at £360 and second-hand options ranging from £160 to £230. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger TX is more expensive, with a new set costing around £420 and second-hand sets priced between £260 and £310.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's worth noting that both brands offer high-quality and reliable lawn bowls. The price difference may reflect the level of technology and craftsmanship that has gone into each model, as well as the popularity of the brand. Ultimately, the decision between the two will come down to personal preference and budget. It's always worth considering buying second hand, as this can save a considerable amount of money. Overall, whatever your choice of lawn bowl, investing in a quality set will ensure a better performance and longevity in the sport.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace lawn bowl is perfect for those who enjoy playing on both indoor and outdoor surfaces. Its mid-bias makes it a versatile option that can adapt to various conditions. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger TX is primarily aimed at indoor bowlers and may not perform as well in outdoor games. Nonetheless, it is an excellent choice for those who frequently play lead as its narrow bias allows for better control and accuracy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the two models will depend on the individual's playing style and preferences. It is advisable to try out both options and see which one feels more comfortable and natural. Whichever bowl you choose, remember that practice and technique are key to honing your skills and mastering the game of lawn bowls.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the Henselite Tiger TX and the Taylor Ace lawn bowls, it is clear that they have their own unique strengths and weaknesses. The Taylor Ace is a versatile bowl that can be used in a variety of conditions and surfaces, while the Henselite Tiger TX is specifically designed for indoor play and is suitable for lead bowlers on fast outdoor greens. However, it should be noted that the Henselite Tiger TX is harder to come by on online marketplaces, making it necessary to purchase them new. Ultimately, the choice of which bowl to use will depend on the individual's preferences and the conditions in which they will be playing.</p>
