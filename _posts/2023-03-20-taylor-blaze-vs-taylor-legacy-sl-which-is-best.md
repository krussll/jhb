<p>In this blog post, I'll be taking a closer look at two popular models of lawn bowls - the Taylor Blaze and the Taylor Legacy SL. I'll be comparing multiple factors such as the bowl's spec, their bias, their grip options, their price, and who they would be ideal for. By the time we're done here, you'll know exactly which lawn bowl is the perfect fit for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze lawn bowl is a mid-biased option that is perfect for indoor and outdoor play. Its versatility allows it to be used on various surfaces and under any conditions. The Blaze is available in sizes 00 to 5, although it's only available in the UK market. For those looking to buy the Blaze, it can be found on second-hand online marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowl is a wide biased bowl that is perfect for outdoor play. It works well on all outdoor surfaces and is best suited for skips. It comes in sizes ranging from 00 to 5, but is only available for the UK market. Additionally, the Taylor Legacy SL can also be found on second hand online marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze and Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowls have different biases, which make them suitable for different playing surfaces and environments. The Blaze is a mid-biased bowl, making it a good choice for both indoor and outdoor play. Meanwhile, the Legacy SL has a wide bias, making it more suitable for outdoor play on a variety of surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Blaze is a versatile bowl that can be used by both indoor and outdoor bowlers. On the other hand, the Legacy SL is specifically designed for outdoor greens and should be avoided if you play predominantly indoors. Ultimately, the best lawn bowl for you will depend on your personal preference and the type of surface you will be playing on.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze and the Taylor Legacy SL have different standard grips. The Taylor Blaze comes with the Taylor Premier grip, which is similar to the Progrip but with oblong dimples. The Taylor Legacy SL comes with the Taylor Progrip, which is a classic dimple grip. Both models do not offer the option of an embedded grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip is deeper and can help bowlers properly grip the bowl, while a dimple grip works by providing small divots for your fingertips to sit in. As for which grip is better, it ultimately depends on personal preference and individual needs. Regardless of the type of grip, both the Taylor Blaze and the Taylor Legacy SL are popular and high-quality models of lawn bowls.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the price comparison between the Taylor Blaze and the Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowls, there is a significant difference to note. The new Taylor Blaze can cost around £360, while the new Taylor Legacy SL is priced at £290. This means that the Blaze is about 24% more expensive than the Legacy SL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it's also worth considering that second-hand options are available for both models. A second-hand Blaze can be purchased for around £210-£230, which is still more expensive than the new Legacy SL. On the other hand, a second-hand Legacy SL is priced around £100-£160, significantly cheaper than both the new Blaze and the second-hand Blaze.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision on which model to go for may come down to personal preference and budget. However, it's clear that the Taylor Legacy SL offers a more affordable option for those on a tighter budget, while the Blaze may appeal to those willing to invest more in a higher-end model.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are looking for a versatile bowl that you can use both indoors and outdoors, the Taylor Blaze would be your best bet. Its mid-bias makes it suitable for multiple surfaces, ensuring consistent performance on a variety of greens. On the other hand, the Taylor Legacy SL is designed specifically for outdoor play, with a wider bias that makes it ideal for greens with heavier and faster playing conditions. If you mostly play outdoors, the Legacy SL could be the perfect choice for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another factor to consider is your level of experience and skill. The Blaze is known for its reliability and ease of use, making it a great option for beginners or those who prefer a straightforward approach to their game. On the other hand, the Legacy SL requires a bit more finesse and precision, making it ideal for more experienced players who are looking for a challenge and are comfortable adapting to different playing conditions. Ultimately, the choice between the two depends on your personal preferences and playing style.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Blaze and Taylor Legacy SL are excellent choices for lawn bowlers. The Blaze, being mid-biased, offers versatility for use on a variety of surfaces and is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. The Legacy SL, on the other hand, is wide biased and is best suited for outdoor play on all surfaces, making it ideal for skips.
