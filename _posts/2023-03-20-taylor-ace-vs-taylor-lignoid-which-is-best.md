<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2690} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It boasts versatility across a range of surfaces and conditions, making it a desirable option for bowlers looking for adaptability. The Ace range is available in sizes 00 to 5, exclusive to the UK market. For those seeking a bargain, the Taylor Ace can also be found on online resale platforms such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid is a wide biased bowl designed for outdoor play, making it suitable for all types of outdoor surfaces, and is especially suited for use by skilled skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5 within the UK market, this bowl can also be purchased second-hand on online marketplaces like eBay. Overall, the Taylor Lignoid is an excellent choice for bowlers looking for a reliable and versatile bowl for their outdoor games.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the Taylor Ace and Lignoid lawn bowls is their bias. The Ace is a mid-biased bowl, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2814} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Lignoid is a wide-biased bowl, which means it is best for outdoor greens and may not perform as well indoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Ace is positioned between the Blaze and the International in the Taylor range, the Lignoid is the widest bowl in the range with a strong hook. The Legacy SL is a wider bowl than both the Ace and the Lignoid but is only suitable for outdoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2811} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the bias of a lawn bowl can greatly impact its performance on different surfaces. Bowlers need to consider the type of green they will be playing on and their personal preferences when choosing between mid-biased and wide-biased bowls.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace and the Taylor Lignoid are two popular models of lawn bowls, and their grips are one of the key differences between them. The Taylor Ace offers a choice between the Progrip and the Taylor Xtreme grip, both of which are top quality. In contrast, the Taylor Lignoid comes with the Taylor Progrip as standard and does not offer an embedded grip option, which some bowlers prefer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl and can help bowlers with grip problems. On the other hand, a dimple grip, like the one offered by the Taylor Progrip, is a classic style where small divots run along the bowl's shoulder for better grip. Ultimately, the choice between embedded and dimple grip comes down to personal preference, and both the Taylor Ace and the Taylor Lignoid offer high-quality options for bowlers.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the price of the Taylor Ace and Taylor Lignoid lawn bowls, it is clear that the latter is the more affordable option. The Taylor Lignoid can be purchased new for £290, while the Taylor Ace is pricier at £360. Similarly, second-hand Taylor Lignoid bowls are available for around £90-130, whereas the Taylor Ace typically sells for £160-£230.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the price difference, both the Taylor Ace and Taylor Lignoid are popular choices among lawn bowls enthusiasts. The Ace is known for its great control and ability to handle tight working conditions, while the Lignoid is praised for its durability thanks to its lignoid composition. Ultimately, the decision between the two comes down to personal preference and individual needs, but for those seeking a more affordable option, the Taylor Lignoid is certainly worth considering.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to choosing between the Taylor Ace and the Taylor Lignoid lawn bowls, it's important to consider the playing surface and conditions. The Taylor Ace is a versatile mid-biased bowl that can be used on both outdoor and indoor surfaces, making it a great choice for players who like to switch between the two. On the other hand, the Taylor Lignoid is a wide biased bowl that is specifically designed for outdoor play. This means it may not perform as well if used on indoor surfaces, so it's best to avoid this model if you primarily play indoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the Taylor Ace is a good choice for players who prefer a more controlled, precise throw. Its mid-biased design allows for a more consistent line and weight, making it easier to achieve accuracy. The Taylor Lignoid, on the other hand, is better suited for players who like to put more spin and movement on the ball. Its wide bias can create a more pronounced hook, making it a great choice for players who want to add some curve to their shots. Ultimately, the best lawn bowl for you will depend on your playing style, preferences, and the conditions you typically play in.</p>
