Together, we'll go over the spec, bias, grip options, price, and even which bowls are best suited for certain players. By the end of this guide, you'll have all the information you need to confidently choose the perfect lawn bowl for you!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer lawn bowl is a narrow biased bowl that is designed for ideal indoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. This bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5, but it's only available for the UK market. It is also possible to find the Taylor Lazer bowl on online second-hand marketplaces, such as eBay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze is a mid-biased lawn bowl that is perfect for both indoor and outdoor play. Its versatility makes it suitable for use on different surfaces and under various conditions. With sizes ranging from 00 to 5, the Taylor Blaze is designed to meet the specific needs of the UK market. Additionally, this bowl can also be purchased on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. Overall, the Taylor Blaze offers a reliable option for any lawn bowler seeking a mid-bias bowl that offers excellent performance under different circumstances.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze and Lazer lawn bowls have different biases that affect their performance on different surfaces. The Lazer is a narrow biased bowl, making it ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. However, due to its narrow bias, it may not be suitable for outdoor bowling in the UK. On the other hand, the Blaze is a mid-biased bowl, which falls between the Vector VS and the Ace in the Taylor range. The Blaze is suitable for both indoor and outdoor greens, making it a versatile option for bowlers of all levels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, the Lazer is a narrow biased bowl that performs well on indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens, while the Blaze is a mid-biased bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor greens. It's important for bowlers to choose the right bowl for their preferred playing surface to maximize their performance and achieve their best results.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Blaze lawn bowls come with standard grips, but they differ in terms of their styles. The Taylor Lazer features the Taylor Progrip, which is a dimple grip and considered one of the best around. However, it doesn't offer an embedded grip option. In contrast, the Taylor Blaze has the Taylor Premier grip, which is similar to the Progrip but with oblong dimples. Like the Lazer, it doesn't have an embedded grip option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip, which is set deeper into the bowl to make it feel smaller in your hand, is great for bowlers who have issues with grip. Meanwhile, a dimple grip is a classic style where small divots or dimples run along the shoulder of the bowl. This provides a better grip for your fingertips. In summary, while the grips of the Lazer and Blaze have some differences, they both provide solid options for lawn bowlers.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to lawn bowls, both the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Blaze are popular options. However, there is a noticeable difference in their prices. The Taylor Lazer comes with a lower price tag, making it a more cost-effective choice for those on a tighter budget. At new retail prices, the Taylor Lazer can be purchased for £290, while a second-hand version can be snagged for around £150-£170. The Taylor Blaze, on the other hand, is a higher-end model that comes with a heftier price tag. A new Taylor Blaze can be purchased for £360, and second-hand versions usually sell for around £210-£230. This means that if you want to go for a high-end option, the Taylor Blaze is a great choice, but if you are looking for something that is more affordable yet still of good quality, the Taylor Lazer is the winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of performance, both the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Blaze are top-notch models that are perfect for lawn bowling enthusiasts. They are both made by the same manufacturer, so you can expect similar quality levels. However, the Taylor Blaze is designed for more experienced players who are looking for a bowl that can deliver precise line and weight control. On the other hand, the Taylor Lazer is a more forgiving bowl that is perfect for beginners or those who are still honing their skills. But regardless of which model you choose, both the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Blaze will give you a great bowling experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer and Taylor Blaze lawn bowls cater to different needs and preferences. The Lazer is best suited to indoor bowls players who want a narrow bias and play lead or front-end positions. On the other hand, the Blaze is a mid-biased bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you play indoors and need a bowl for lead or front-end positions, the Lazer is a great option. Its narrow bias makes it easy to control and precision is essential in these positions. However, if you want to use your bowls both indoors and outdoors, and play different positions, the Blaze is a solid fit. Its mid-bias means it has a wider line of running, making it more versatile and adaptable to different surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, choosing between the two popular Taylor models will depend on your bowling style, preferred position, and where you plan to play. Whether it's the Lazer or the Blaze, Taylor bowls are renowned for their quality and performance, so you can't go wrong with either.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, although both the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Blaze are popular models of lawn bowls from the same brand, they are designed for different purposes. The Taylor Lazer is best suited for indoor play or for those who play lead on fast outdoor greens, whereas the Taylor Blaze is a versatile bowl that can be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions both indoors and outdoors. Both models are available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and can be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.
