<h2>Bias</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger and Drakes Pride XP lawn bowls are wide biased and ideal for outdoor greens. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2828} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the two bowls is that the Tiger is slightly wider than the XP and should be avoided for indoor play. However, the XP is suitable for all outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both brands are reputable and popular among lawn bowlers, and the decision between them would ultimately come down to personal preferences and individual playing styles. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is recommended to try both bowls before making a decision on which one to use regularly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger comes equipped with the Heneslite Mega grip, which is an embedded grip set deeper into the bowl, making the bowl feel smaller in the hands. This type of grip is beneficial for bowlers who face difficulty in gripping the bowl. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP only provides the standard dimple grip, which features small divots that run along the shoulder of the bowl. The idea behind this design is to provide an enhanced grip by allowing the fingertips to sit in the dimples.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, while both lawn bowls are popular models, they differ in terms of the grips they offer. The Henselite Tiger features an embedded grip that caters to bowlers struggling with gripping the bowl, and the Drakes Pride XP has a classic dimple grip that allows for a better grip. It ultimately comes down to personal preference, and it is recommended that bowlers try out both models to determine which grip works best for them.</p>
