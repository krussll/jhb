<p>In this post, I'll be taking a closer look at two popular models - the Taylor Legacy SL and the Henselite Tiger EVO - and comparing their specs, bias, grip options, and price to help you make an informed decision. By the end, you'll have a clear idea of which bowl will suit you best. So, let's dive in!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL is a wide-biased lawn bowl specifically designed for outdoor play. It performs exceptionally well on a variety of outdoor surfaces and is highly recommended for skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5, the Taylor Legacy SL is only available in the UK market. While it may be difficult to find new, this bowl can often be purchased second-hand on online marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl that is great for outdoor play. It is versatile and can be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions. It comes in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and can be difficult to find on second-hand marketplaces. If you want this bowl, it's likely that you'll have to buy it new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger EVO and Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowls are biased towards the wide side, which makes them suitable for outdoor greens. The Legacy SL is wider than the Tiger EVO and is a good choice for those who play predominantly on natural turf. On the other hand, the Tiger EVO is a midbiased/wide biased bowl and is suitable for all outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between the two bowls will depend on the player's personal preference and the type of surface they play on. Both are suited for outdoor greens, but the Legacy SL is a wider biased bowl and ideal for players who enjoy natural greens, while the Tiger EVO is more versatile and can be used on different outdoor surfaces.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The grips of the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Taylor Legacy SL are different in design and functionality. The Taylor Legacy SL features the standard Taylor Progrip, which is considered one of the best dimple grips available. In contrast, the Henselite Tiger EVO comes with the Heneslite Mega grip, which is an embedded grip that is set deeper into the bowl. This makes it ideal for bowlers who struggle with gripping the ball properly, as it feels smaller in the hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the popularity of dimple grips, an embedded grip is thought to be more superior due to its deeper embedding, providing a more secure grip. However, the Taylor Legacy SL does not offer an embedded grip option, limiting its versatility. Ultimately, the choice between these two models depends on individual preferences and playing style.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the price of the Taylor Legacy SL and the Henselite Tiger EVO lawn bowls, there is a notable difference. The Taylor Legacy SL is significantly cheaper, with a new set costing around £290 and a second-hand set costing between £100-£160.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger EVO is notably more expensive, with a brand new set costing around £400. Even second-hand sets can be quite pricey, with prices ranging from £250-£300.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the higher price of the Henselite Tiger EVO may be a deterrent for some, it's worth considering the potential benefits of this model before making a decision based solely on cost. Both options offer quality construction and playability, so it ultimately comes down to personal preference and budget.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL and the Henselite Tiger EVO are two popular models of lawn bowls that are suited to different types of players. The Taylor Legacy SL is a wide-biased bowl that is ideal for outdoor play. It's best suited for players who prefer to play outdoors and are experienced enough to handle the wider bias. The wider bias on the Taylor Legacy SL allows for a larger footprint, which increases stability on outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-biased bowl that is versatile enough to be played on all surfaces. It's aimed towards players who play predominantly outdoors, but it can be played indoors as well. The mid-bias on the Henselite Tiger EVO means that it's not as wide as the Taylor Legacy SL, but it's still stable enough to maintain its line on outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, if you're an experienced outdoor player who wants a wider bias for more stability on outdoor surfaces, the Taylor Legacy SL is the best choice. If you want a versatile bowl that can be played on all surfaces, but with a slightly narrower bias, the Henselite Tiger EVO is a better option. Ultimately, the choice between the two models comes down to personal preference and playing style.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the two models of lawn bowls, the Taylor Legacy SL and the Henselite Tiger EVO, it's clear that both have their strengths. The Taylor Legacy SL is ideal for outdoor play and suited to skips, while the Henselite Tiger EVO is a versatile bowl that can be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions.
