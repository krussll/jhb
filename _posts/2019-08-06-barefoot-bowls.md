<h2><a href="#what-you-need-to-know-about-barefoot-lawn-bowls"></a>What You Need to Know About Barefoot Lawn Bowls</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You do not need bowling expertise to participate in barefoot bowling. However, it is important to know how the game is played and some of its basics, to get started. Remember the objective of this game is to get your bowls as close to the jack as possible than your opponent's. Here are several things you need to know about barefoot Lawn Bowls</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#the-bowls"></a>The bowls</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are the balls you use when playing, up to four bowls per player. The bowl is weighted on one side and it is made to provide the bowl with some weight bias. This nature of the bowls enables them to curve and turn while rolling, they, therefore, do not move in a straight line. Aiming the bowl to the precise target area is where the challenge of the game lies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are different colours for different bowls and they all weigh about 1.5Kg.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They are often provided for you when you play, so there is no need to buy a set of your own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#the-mat"></a>The mat</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a pad where players usually stand on while bowling. It is usually placed on the central line of the rink.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#rink-lane"></a>Rink (lane)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the grass region where the actual play takes place. It is usually demarcated using some boundary pegs. There are several rinks within a lawn to allow several games to be run at the same time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#centre-line"></a>Centre line</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the line that runs to the centre of the rink.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#the-jack"></a>The jack</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack is a white ball, also known as the kitty, which acts as the target of the game. The concept of the game is to deliver bowls as close to the jack as possible. Getting to the jack is not as easy as you would anticipate, but that is where the interest of the game lies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#the-grip"></a>The grip</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How comfortable you hold the bowl determines how good you will deliver it. A comfortable grip should have your middle finger centrally positioned on the bowl. It also implies that you should have a bowl of considerable size for your hands. Bowls are made of different sizes ranging from zero for smaller hands to five for larger hands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#the-green"></a>The green</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The green is a large square lawn with an approximate measurement of 30m by 30m or 40m by 40m. The green is divided into several rinks which should be large enough to accommodate the barefoot bowling experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#the-draw-shot"></a>The draw shot</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the most challenging shot for players. It requires a balanced distribution of weight to have a precise movement of the bowl right to where the jack is. The bowl moves at a slow continuous motion, making it the hardest shot to make.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#the-drive-shot"></a>The drive shot</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This shot moves at a very high speed with an intended high level of accuracy. When the opponent’s bowl is closest to the jack, the drive shot is the ultimate tool to apply. The intention is to knock the opponent’s bowl off the jack to a further position along the rink. The drive shot can be perilous when directed to someone’s ankles due to the force and speed of its movement. It should be used with caution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#the-yard-shot"></a>The yard shot</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a very strategic shot. It has two objectives. One is to push the jack away from your opponent, drawing it closer to your advantage. The second objective is to push the opponent’s bowl out of its head to have yours take the position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that you know the basic rules to the playing of the game, here is how you do the bowling;</p>

<h2><a href="#how-scores-are-determined-in-barefoot-bowling"></a>How Scores are Determined in Barefoot Bowling</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aiming at the jack is the central objective of this game. Scores are, therefore, awarded based on the team with the bowls closest to the jack. The higher the number of bowls closest to the jack, the higher the scores. The distance between the bowls and the jack is measured by eye by the players of the two teams. In case of dispute over the range, a measuring tape is used. When there are further disagreements on the scores, an umpire is called upon to determine which team wins. An umpire is an official appointed by particular barefoot Lawn Bowls clubs to see the smooth running of the game.</p>
