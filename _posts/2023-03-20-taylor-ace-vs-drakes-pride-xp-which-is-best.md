<p>The Drakes Pride XP is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. It is suitable for all outdoor surfaces and is particularly well-suited for skip players.

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of the Drakes Pride XP and the Taylor Ace lawn bowls is their level of bias. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2814} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The XP is a wide-biased bowl, while the Ace is a mid-biased bowl. This means that the XP will curve more significantly than the Ace when rolled, making it ideal for outdoor greens and all outdoor surfaces. The Ace, on the other hand, is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play, and is better suited for players who want a moderate level of bias.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between the Drakes Pride XP and the Taylor Ace will depend on the preferences and needs of the individual player. Those who play primarily on outdoor greens may prefer the greater level of bias provided by the XP, while those who play on a variety of surfaces or want a more versatile bowl may opt for the Ace. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, it is important to try out different bowls and find the one that feels most comfortable and effective for your particular style of play.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace and Drakes Pride XP are both popular models of lawn bowls, but they have different grip options available. The Taylor Ace offers a choice between the Progrip and the Xtreme grip, while the Drakes Pride XP is only available with a standard dimple grip. The Progrip and Xtreme grip have different textures but are designed to suit every preference. Meanwhile, the embedded grip of the Taylor Ace feels smaller in hand and may benefit bowlers who have trouble gripping the bowl properly. The Drakes Pride XP's classic dimple grip has small divots that help provide better grip for the bowler's fingers. Each grip option has its own benefits to cater to various bowlers' preferences and needs.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the price of the Taylor Ace and the Drakes Pride XP, it's important to note that while the Taylor Ace is generally more expensive, it also tends to retain its value better when bought second hand. A new set of Taylor Aces will set you back around £360, while a new set of Drakes Pride XP will cost around £290.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if you're on a budget and don't mind buying second hand, you could pick up a set of either bowls for a fraction of the price. Second hand Taylor Aces tend to range from £160-£230, while second hand Drakes Pride XP can be found for around £140-£250.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, it's important to consider both the initial cost and the potential resale value when deciding which lawn bowls to invest in. While the Taylor Ace may be more expensive up front, it may end up being a better long-term investment. However, if you're on a tight budget, the Drakes Pride XP is a great option for a more affordable new set of lawn bowls.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace lawn bowl and the Drakes Pride XP lawn bowl are both great choices for lawn bowling enthusiasts, but they differ in their biased type and suitability for specific playing surfaces. If you enjoy playing both indoors and outdoors, then the mid-biased Taylor Ace is the perfect fit for you. Its versatility allows for smooth play on both surfaces, providing consistent results every time. However, if you primarily play outdoors, then the wide-biased Drakes Pride XP is the ideal choice. Its unique design excels in outdoor environments, providing excellent control and stability on uneven surfaces. So, when choosing between the two, it ultimately comes down to where you prefer to play and what kind of biased bowl you prefer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Ace and the Drakes Pride XP are excellent lawn bowls with their own unique features. The Taylor Ace is a versatile bowl that can be used for indoor and outdoor play on a variety of surfaces and conditions, while the Drakes Pride XP is a specialized bowl for outdoor play on all surfaces, with a wider bias and suited for skips. However, if you are looking for a second-hand option, it may be easier to find the Taylor Ace on online marketplaces. Ultimately, the choice between these two bowls will depend on your personal preference and playing style.</p>
