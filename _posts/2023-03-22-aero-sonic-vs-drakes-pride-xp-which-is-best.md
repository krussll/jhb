<p>I'll go over the spec, bias, grip options, price, and who each bowl is best suited for. My goal is to help you make a confident decision and find the perfect bowl for your needs. Let's dive in!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2735} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Sonic is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. It is suitable for all outdoor surfaces and is particularly well-suited for skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, the Aero Sonic is a popular choice for lawn bowlers. While it may be difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay, new options are readily available for purchase.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride XP is a wide biased lawn bowl, designed for outdoor play on all surfaces. Ideal for skip players, it is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only. While it may be difficult to find second-hand, purchasing new is always an option.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Drakes Pride XP and Aero Sonic lawn bowls are wide-biased and suitable for outdoor greens. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2833} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Sonic is considered mid-biased/wide biased, while the XP is simply wide biased. The Sonic is the widest bowl in the Aero range, and the XP is the widest bowl in the Drakes Pride range. Both models are suitable for all outdoor surfaces, making them versatile choices for lawn bowling enthusiasts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, there is not a significant difference in bias between the two models. The Sonic may be slightly more mid-biased, which could make it a better choice for certain types of outdoor greens. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2801} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, both the XP and Sonic are designed for use on all outdoor surfaces and are suitable for a wide range of players. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two models will likely come down to personal preference, rather than bias differences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of the Aero Sonic and Drakes Pride XP lawn bowls, it's clear that Aero offers more options. With three types of grips available, including a dimple, embedded, and non-gripped option, bowlers have the ability to choose the grip that suits them best at no extra cost. Additionally, all grip options are available on the entire Aero range, providing consistency for players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, Drakes Pride only offers their standard dimple grip on the XP lawn bowl. While this classic style of grip may work well for some bowlers, those who struggle with gripping the bowl may benefit from the embedded grip offered by Aero. This deeper grip allows the bowl to feel smaller in the hand and can provide a more secure clutch for those who need it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while the Drakes Pride XP offers a solid dimple grip, the range of options provided by Aero gives players greater flexibility to select the grip that works best for them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, it's clear that the Drakes Pride XP is the more affordable option compared to the Aero Sonic. A new set of XP bowls can be purchased for around £290, while the Aero Sonic will set you back approximately £400. This price difference is quite significant and may be a determining factor for those on a budget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even if you're in the market for pre-owned bowls, the XP is the more wallet-friendly option. Second-hand Drakes Pride XP bowls can be found for as little as £140, while used Aero Sonic bowls are typically priced between £300-£360. In terms of affordability, it's reasonable to say that the Drakes Pride XP has the clear advantage over the Aero Sonic.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Aero Sonic and Drakes Pride XP cater to different types of players. The Aero Sonic is perfect for outdoor players who want versatility in their positioning on a team. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is specifically designed for outdoor play and has a wide bias, making it better suited for those who play solely outdoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you enjoy playing both indoors and outdoors, the Aero Sonic would be the better choice for you. It's a great all-rounder bowl that can be used in multiple positions on a team. However, if you only play outdoors, the Drakes Pride XP should be at the top of your list. Its wide bias makes it ideal for outdoor conditions and it's not recommended for indoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and what works best for your playing style. Both bowls are popular for a reason and are trusted by players worldwide. Knowing what type of player you are and what conditions you play in can help you choose between the Aero Sonic and Drakes Pride XP.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Aero Sonic and the Drakes Pride XP are great options for outdoor lawn bowling. They share similar characteristics, including wide bias and suitability for various outdoor surfaces and skip players. However, the availability of these bowls on the second-hand marketplaces such as eBay is limited, and buyers may need to purchase them new. Ultimately, the choice between these two models may come down to personal preferences and individual needs.</p>
