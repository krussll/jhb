<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<h2>Benefits of polishing bowls</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are several reasons why you should polish your bowls regularly. These include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>help protect them from wear and tear</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>brings back the shine - makes them look as good as new</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>makes the bowls "tacky" which improves your grip</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many bowlers use polishes solely to improve their grip. I for one use a polish before I play a game. However the benefits go beyond simple grip improvements and asthetics.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowls polishes are great for keeping your bowls in tip top condition. Polishes helps clear any minor marks and scratches, and also protects them from damage during a game.</p>

<h2>When you shouldn't polish lawn bowls</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whilst polishing your bowls is great for keeping them in tip top shape, it is best to not polish them before playing on any kind of indoor carpet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many indoor clubs (but not all) ban the use of polishes when you use their facilities because it can damage the carpet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can imagine replacing the carpet is an expensive operation, and protecting the surface is a top priority for many clubs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whilst not all indoor clubs have this rule, its usually best to err on the side of caution and not use polishes during the indoor season as any residue may still be on the surface of the bowl for several weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowls polishes are great for improving the lifespan of your bowls and for improving your grip when you play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Applying it is incredibly easy regardless of the type or brand that you use. All you need is a dab of a cloth and away you go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just be careful when you use it, especially on indoor surfaces, as it can cause some damage to the carpet - so be on the safe side and keep it for the outdoor season only.</p>
