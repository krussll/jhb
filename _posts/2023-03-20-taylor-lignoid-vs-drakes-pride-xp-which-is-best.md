<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play, with a suitable bias for skips. It comes in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only and is ideal for use on all outdoor surfaces. If you're looking for a Taylor Lignoid bowl, you may be able to find one on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride XP is a wide biased lawn bowl that is perfect for outdoor play on various surfaces. It is designed to cater for skips and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only. While it is hard to find the Drakes Pride XP on second hand online marketplaces like eBay, buyers can purchase them new for the best quality experience.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lignoid and Drakes Pride XP lawn bowls have a wide bias, making them suitable for outdoor greens. However, the Lignoid is slightly wider than the XP and is recommended for outdoor greens specifically, while the XP is suitable for all outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's worth noting that both bowls may not be ideal for indoor play, as the Lignoid is recommended for outdoor play only and the XP's wider bias may prove difficult on indoor surfaces. Overall, both the Lignoid and XP offer a reliable option for outdoor play, with the Lignoid being slightly more specialized in its use.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grip, the Taylor Lignoid offers the option of the Taylor Progrip, which is considered one of the best dimple grips available. However, it doesn't come with the option of an embedded grip, which offers a deeper feel in the hand, ideal for bowlers who struggle with grip. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP only offers their standard dimple grip. While a classic style of grip, it may not be suitable for bowlers who require more depth for proper grip. When comparing the two, it is important to consider the individual bowler's needs and preferences.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, both the Taylor Lignoid and the Drakes Pride XP are quite similar. Both models can be purchased new for around £290, which puts them in the same price range. However, if you are looking for a second-hand option, you may find some slight differences in price. The Taylor Lignoid is available for a lower price of £90-130, whereas the Drakes Pride XP second-hand option can cost you around £140-250.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is important to note that the price difference between a new and second-hand option is quite significant for both models. Therefore, if you are looking to save some money, buying a second-hand option of either model can be a good idea. However, it is crucial to ensure that the used lawn bowls are in good condition and have been well maintained, especially if you are looking to play competitively. Overall, both the Taylor Lignoid and the Drakes Pride XP offer similar price options, making them both popular choices among lawn bowl enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lignoid and the Drakes Pride XP are wide biased lawn bowls designed for outdoor play. They offer similar characteristics in terms of performance and playability. However, the Taylor Lignoid is specifically designed for outdoor use, which means it may not be suitable for indoor bowling. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is also designed for outdoor play but can be used for indoor play as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, if you are someone who plays exclusively outdoors, the Taylor Lignoid is a great option. However, if you occasionally play indoors as well, the Drakes Pride XP would be a better choice. Ultimately, the decision between these two popular models of lawn bowls comes down to personal preference, style of play, and the specific requirements of the game.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Lignoid and the Drakes Pride XP are ideal choices for outdoor play on all surfaces, and suited to skips. The main difference seems to be in availability - the Taylor Lignoid can be found on online second hand marketplaces like eBay, while the Drakes Pride XP is harder to come by and often needs to be purchased new. However, both models are wide biased bowls available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on personal preference and availability.</p>
