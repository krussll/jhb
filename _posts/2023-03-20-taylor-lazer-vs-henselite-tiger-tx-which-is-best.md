<p>Together, we'll take a look at important factors like bowl specifications, bias, grip options, pricing, and who each bowl is best suited for. By the time we're finished, you'll have all the information you need to make an informed decision and choose the perfect bowl for you. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer lawn bowl is a popular choice for indoor bowlers or lead players on fast outdoor greens. It features a narrow bias and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. The Taylor Lazer can be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay. Overall, this bowl is ideal for those looking for precise control and accuracy in their bowling game.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX is a narrow-biased bowl, designed for optimum performance during indoor play. It is ideal for players who are seeking accurate line and length control. The bowl is best suited for lead players on fast outdoor greens and is only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. It may be challenging to find the Henselite Tiger TX on secondhand marketplaces such as eBay, and players may need to purchase them new to ensure they have access to the latest technology and design.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lazer and the Henselite Tiger TX lawn bowls are narrow biased and ideal for indoor rinks. However, the Lazer is the narrowest biased bowl in the Taylor range while the Tiger TX is the narrowest biased bowl in the Henselite range. The Lazer is better suited for fast outdoor greens and should be avoided if playing predominantly outdoors in the UK. On the other hand, the Tiger TX is also suitable for indoor bowlers but has a narrower bias, making it more suitable for indoor play.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both bowls have their specific advantages and disadvantages depending on the type of rink and play style. It is important to choose the right bowl for your specific needs to ensure the best performance and accuracy in your game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer and Henselite Tiger TX are two popular models of lawn bowls, each with their own unique grips. The Taylor Lazer features the Taylor Progrip, which is a dimple grip and is highly rated among bowlers. However, it does not offer the option of an embedded grip, which is considered to be superior to dimple grips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger TX comes with the Henselite Mega grip as standard, which is an embedded grip. Embedded grips are set deeper into the bowl and can make the bowl feel smaller in your hand, which may be beneficial for those who struggle with grip. Overall, while both grips have their advantages, the choice between them may come down to personal preference and comfort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of price, the Taylor Lazer costs significantly less than the Henselite Tiger TX. A new Taylor Lazer can be purchased for £290, while a brand new Henselite Tiger TX will set you back around £420. The cost of a secondhand Taylor Lazer falls between £150-£170, while the secondhand Henselite Tiger TX typically ranges from £260-£310.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Henselite Tiger TX is a more expensive option, some bowlers may find the added cost worth it for the enhanced performance and features that come with this model. However, for those on a tighter budget, the Taylor Lazer may be a more accessible option that still offers a high-quality bowl for lawn bowling enthusiasts. Ultimately, the decision between the two models will come down to personal preference, playing style, and budget.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After comparing the features of Taylor Lazer and Henselite Tiger TX, it is evident that both these models are suited for indoor bowling and have a narrow bias. Hence, they may not be ideal for outdoor bowling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, these models are ideal for beginners or lead bowlers who prefer a narrow bias. Both these models provide a consistent and controlled delivery that can help bowlers improve their accuracy over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between the two models ultimately comes down to personal preference. While they offer similar features, slight differences in their design may appeal to different individuals. So, it is recommended for bowlers to try out both models before making a final decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lazer and the Henselite Tiger TX are great options for indoor bowlers and those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. They are both narrow biased bowls available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only. However, the Henselite Tiger TX is harder to find on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay and is more realistically purchased new. Ultimately, the choice between the two will come down to personal preference and availability.</p>
