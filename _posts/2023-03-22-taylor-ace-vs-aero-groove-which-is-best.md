<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2690} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace lawn bowl is a mid-biased model that works well for both indoor and outdoor play.

<p>The Aero GrooVe lawn bowl is a mid-biased bowl designed for both indoor and outdoor play. Its versatility makes it ideal for use on various terrains and playing conditions. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, the Aero GrooVe is a high-quality bowl that is sought-after by many players. However, because of its popularity and limited availability, it can be hard to find on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay. Purchasing a new set may be the best option for those looking to play with this top-performing lawn bowl.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Ace and the Aero GrooVe lawn bowls are mid-biased, which makes them suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2814} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace sits between the Blaze and International in the Taylor range, while the GrooVe sits between the Quantum and the Sonic in the Aero range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace is known for its versatility, making it an ideal option for players who play on a variety of greens. It is a popular choice for indoor rinks due to its mid-bias and performance characteristics. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2822} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Aero GrooVe is a new addition to the Aero range, but player reviews suggest that it is a high-performing bowl that is also suitable for both indoor and outdoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while both bowls have similar mid-bias characteristics, personal preference and playing style can heavily influence the choice between the two. Players should try both options and determine which bowl best suits their individual needs and preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grip options, the Aero GrooVe has a clear advantage over the Taylor Ace. Aero offers a variety of grip options including dimple, embedded, and non-grip, which come as standard and do not cost extra. In contrast, the Taylor Ace offers a choice between two grip options, the Progrip and the Taylor Xtreme grip, as standard. Although both options are of top quality, the limited selection may not suit everyone's preference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another difference between the two models is the way the embedded grip affects the bowl's size in your hand. The Taylor Ace's embedded grip is shallower compared to the Aero GrooVe, which is set deeper into the bowl. This makes the Taylor Ace feel less smaller in the hand, which may be preferred by some bowlers. However, the deeper embedded grip of the Aero GrooVe is ideal for bowlers who have difficulty gripping the bowl securely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, if you value a wide variety of grip options, the Aero GrooVe would be the better option for you. However, if you prefer a shallower embedded grip or a classic dimple grip, the Taylor Ace could be a perfect fit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Taylor Ace and the Aero GrooVe lawn bowls, it is clear that both models are quite expensive. However, the Aero GrooVe is slightly more costly than the Taylor Ace, with a new set costing around £400, compared to £360 for the Taylor Ace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, you may be able to find a better deal on a second-hand set of the Taylor Ace, with prices ranging from £160-£230, whereas second-hand Aero GrooVe's typically sell for around £300-£360.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, both of these bowls are top-of-the-line models, and your choice will come down to personal preference and budget. While the Aero GrooVe may have a slight edge in terms of performance, you may be able to save some money by opting for the Taylor Ace or a second-hand set of either bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace lawn bowls would best suit bowlers who prefer a mid-biased bowl and play on a variety of surfaces, including indoor and outdoor greens. Its versatility makes it ideal for those who want a bowl that performs consistently across different terrains. Whether it's an open green or a tighter indoor space, the Taylor Ace offers a great balance of control and accuracy, making it a reliable choice for players of all skill levels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Aero GrooVe lawn bowl is perfect for those seeking a dual-purpose bowl that can adapt to different positions in a team game. It offers bowlers the flexibility to play both indoors and outdoors without having to switch bowls, making it a cost-effective option. The Aero GrooVe's unique GrooVe Technology design also promotes stability and accuracy, enabling players to confidently take on challenging shots. Bowlers who play in multiple positions in a team will benefit from the Aero GrooVe's adaptability and precision.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Ace and the Aero GrooVe are high-quality lawn bowls that offer versatility and reliability for indoor and outdoor play. However, the Aero GrooVe may be slightly more difficult to obtain compared to the Taylor Ace, as it is often only available for purchase new rather than through second-hand marketplaces such as eBay. Ultimately, the choice between these two models may come down to personal preference and individual needs.</p>
