<p>The Henselite Tiger TX comes with the embedded Heneslite Mega grip, while the Drakes Pride Professional only offers standard dimple grip. The embedded grip sits deeper in the bowl, making it feel smaller and aiding bowlers with grip issues. The dimple grip features small divots along the shoulder of the bowl to give players a better grip. Overall, the choice between the two grips will largely depend on personal preference and individual needs.</p>
