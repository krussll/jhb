<p>We will discuss their specs, bias, grip options, price, and who they are best suited for. By the end of this guide, you will have a clear understanding of which lawn bowl is the perfect match for you. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2732} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX is a narrow biased lawn bowl, specifically designed for indoor play. It is ideal for players who play lead position in fast outdoor greens as well. This model is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. Finding this bowl on second-hand marketplaces might be challenging, so buying new might be necessary.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowl is a mid-biased and versatile option suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. Its available size range is from 00 to 5, and it is marketed exclusively in the UK. Additionally, the bowl can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX is a narrow biased bowl that is ideal for indoor rinks, and is suitable for indoor bowlers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2835} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It should be avoided if you play predominantly outdoors in the UK. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 has a mid-bias and is suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowling. It is perfect for those who play on both indoor rinks and outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both the Tiger TX and PRO-50 have different biases and are best suited for different playing environments, it ultimately comes down to personal preference. Some players may prefer the narrow bias of the Tiger TX for indoor play, while others may prefer the versatility of the mid-bias PRO-50 for both indoor and outdoor play. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regardless, with either bowl, a skilled player will be able to make the necessary adjustments to achieve the desired results on the green.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger TX and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowls come with embedded grip options. However, the Henselite Tiger TX features the Henselite Mega grip as its standard, while the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offers its embedded grip as an option. An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, which gives bowlers with grip problems an advantage. In contrast, a dimple grip is a classic grip style that features small divots along the shoulder of the bowl. The Henselite Tiger TX does not have this classic dimple grip, but the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offers it as a choice.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Henselite Tiger TX is more expensive than the Drakes Pride PRO-50. A brand new Tiger TX can cost around £420, whereas a new PRO-50 can be purchased for around £300. However, if you are looking for a bargain, the second-hand market is an option. You could get a Tiger TX for around £260-310 or a PRO-50 for around £190-260.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While price is an important consideration, it's worth noting that other factors may also influence your purchasing decision. For example, some bowlers may consider the design, grip, weight, and bias of the bowls, as well as the reputation and support of the brand. Ultimately, the right choice for you will depend on your individual preferences, budget, and playing style.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>: If you are an indoor bowler who frequently plays the lead position, the Henselite Tiger TX might be the best choice for you with its narrow bias. However, if you play on both indoor and outdoor surfaces and want a single bowl that can perform well on either, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 is designed to be mid-biased and versatile enough for various playing conditions. Consider your playing style and surface of choice when choosing between these two models of lawn bowls.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, between the Henselite Tiger TX and the Drakes Pride PRO-50, the latter is the more versatile option for both indoor and outdoor play. While the Tiger TX is ideal for narrow bias and indoor use, the PRO-50 offers mid-bias and can handle a variety of surfaces and conditions. Additionally, the PRO-50 may be more accessible for those looking for second-hand options as it can be found on marketplaces such as eBay. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the player's individual needs and preferences.</p>
