<p>We'll take a look at their specs, bias, grip options, price, and who they're best suited for. By the end of this guide, you'll feel confident in your decision and know which bowl is the right fit for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer is a narrow biased lawn bowl that is most suitable for indoor play or for playing lead on fast outdoor greens. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and can be found online second-hand marketplaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a versatile and mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl that is ideal for outdoor play. It can be used on various surfaces and conditions, available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. However, it may be difficult to find second-hand options online, so purchasing new may be necessary.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Taylor Lazer is a narrower biased bowl than the Henselite Tiger EVO, making it ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. However, if you primarily play outdoors in the UK, the Taylor Lazer may not be the best choice for you. In contrast, the Henselite Tiger EVO is a midbiased/wide biased bowl and is well-suited for outdoor greens of all surfaces. Its bias lies between the Tiger Pro and the Tiger in the Henselite range, making it a versatile option for a range of different players and conditions. Ultimately, when deciding between these two bowls, your choice should depend on your personal playing style, as well as the type of greens you will be playing on.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grips, the Henselite Tiger EVO has an advantage over the Taylor Lazer with its embedded Heneslite Mega grip. This deeper set grip makes the bowl feel smaller in your hand which can be beneficial for those struggling with grip. On the other hand, the Taylor Lazer comes with the Taylor Progrip, a classic dimple grip which allows your fingertips to sit in small divots along the shoulder of the bowl giving you a secure hold. However, unlike the Henselite Tiger EVO, the Taylor Lazer does not offer the option of an embedded grip. Ultimately, the choice between these two models and their grips comes down to personal preference and what feels best in your hand.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Taylor Lazer has a clear advantage over the Henselite Tiger EVO. New, the Taylor Lazer comes in at around £290, while the Henselite Tiger EVO costs around £400. This is a significant difference in price that may sway budget-conscious buyers towards the Taylor Lazer. Even second-hand, the Taylor Lazer remains more affordable, with prices ranging between £150-£170, compared to the Henselite Tiger EVO's second-hand price range of £250-£300.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, price isn't everything when it comes to choosing lawn bowls. It's important to consider factors such as performance and durability as well. So, while the Taylor Lazer may be a more budget-friendly option, it's still important to weigh this against the Henselite Tiger EVO's potential benefits to determine which model is the best choice for your needs and preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are an indoor bowler who frequently plays lead, the Taylor Lazer is likely the better choice for you. With its narrow bias, it is ideal for straighter, more accurate shots. However, if you primarily play outdoors, the Henselite Tiger EVO may be a better fit for you. Its mid-bias allows for slightly more curve, which can be advantageous on outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, if you are a beginner, you may find the Taylor Lazer easier to handle due to its narrow bias. However, more experienced bowlers may prefer the versatility of the Henselite Tiger EVO, which can be played on a variety of surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between these two popular models of lawn bowls will depend on your playing style and preferences. It is important to consider these factors before making a purchase to ensure you select a bowl that will best suit your needs.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After comparing the Taylor Lazer and the Henselite Tiger EVO lawn bowls, it is clear that both have unique features and are suitable for different types of players and environments. The Taylor Lazer is best for narrower and faster greens, making it a popular choice for indoor play or as a lead outdoor bowler. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger EVO is more versatile and can be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions, making it a top choice for outdoor play. Both bowls come in various sizes, but the availability of the Henselite Tiger EVO may be limited when it comes to online second-hand marketplaces. Overall, choosing between the two will depend on individual preferences and playing styles.</p>
