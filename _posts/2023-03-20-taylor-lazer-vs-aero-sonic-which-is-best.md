<p>In this blog post, I'll be comparing two popular models - the Taylor Lazer and the Aero Sonic - to help you make a well-informed decision. I'll be discussing the specifications, bias, grip options, price, and who would benefit most from each bowl. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clearer idea of which bowl is the best choice for you!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer is a highly specialized lawn bowl designed for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. It has a narrow bias and is available in sizes 00 to 5 exclusively for the UK market. This bowl is specifically targeted towards indoor bowlers or those who play lead on outdoor greens. If you're looking for a Taylor Lazer, you can find them on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. Overall, the Taylor Lazer is best for players who want a precise and controlled shot.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Sonic is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play, particularly on uneven surfaces. Its bias makes it ideal for skips, with sizes ranging from 00 to 5 in the UK market. However, it may be difficult to find second-hand Aero Sonic bowls as they are more commonly purchased new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparison, The Aero Sonic lawn bowl has a mid to wide bias suited for outdoor greens, while the Taylor Lazer lawn bowl has a narrow bias ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. The Lazer is the narrowest biased bowl in the Taylor range, whereas the Sonic is the widest bowl in the Aero range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a result, the choice between the two bowls depends on the player's preferred playing surface. The Sonic is suitable for all outdoor surfaces, but the Lazer should be avoided if the player predominately plays outdoors in the UK. Therefore, the selection of the lawn bowl should be based upon the bias that matches the surface and the player's style of play.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the grips of the Aero Sonic and Taylor Lazer lawn bowls, it's clear that the Aero Sonic offers more options. The Aero Sonic comes with three different grip options including dimple, embedded, and non-gripped, all at no extra cost. In contrast, the Taylor Lazer only comes with the Progrip, which is a dimple grip. While the Progrip is considered one of the best dimple grips available, it doesn't offer the same level of customization as the Aero Sonic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One significant difference between the two grips is that an embedded grip is deeper and can make the bowl feel smaller in your hand. This feature is beneficial for bowlers who have difficulty gripping the bowl, providing them with more control. In contrast, the dimple grip is a classic style that is popular among bowlers. The small divots or dimples along the shoulder of the bowl give your fingers a better grip, helping you to deliver your shot with greater accuracy. Ultimately, the choice between these two popular models of lawn bowls will depend on your grip preferences and bowling technique.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the price of the Taylor Lazer and the Aero Sonic lawn bowls, it's clear that the latter is more expensive. The Taylor Lazer can be purchased for £290 new or between £150-£170 second hand, while the Aero Sonic comes in at around £400 new and between £300-£360 second hand if you're lucky enough to find a set. Those looking to save some money may find the Taylor Lazer to be a more budget-friendly option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it's important to note that the higher price tag of the Aero Sonic may come with added benefits. For example, some bowlers may find that the Aero Sonic's design and construction offer a superior performance or better grip. Ultimately, the decision of which lawn bowl to purchase will depend on the individual's budget and preferences for how their bowl performs on the green.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you primarily bowl indoors and play lead, the Taylor Lazer is the perfect option for you with its narrow bias. However, if you prefer outdoor bowling, the Aero Sonic would be a better choice with its versatility and strong performance in outdoor conditions. Additionally, the Aero Sonic is suitable for players in various positions within a team, making it a great option for anyone looking for flexibility on the field. Ultimately, the decision depends on your specific needs and preferences in a lawn bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing The Aero Sonic lawn bowl and The Taylor Lazer, it is clear that they cater to very different needs. The Taylor Lazer is designed to cater to indoor play, while The Aero Sonic is ideal for outdoor surfaces. Additionally, while The Taylor Lazer can be found on second hand marketplaces such as eBay, The Aero Sonic is hard to find and realistically will need to be purchased new. Ultimately, the choice between the two bowls comes down to individual preferences and playing environments.</p>
