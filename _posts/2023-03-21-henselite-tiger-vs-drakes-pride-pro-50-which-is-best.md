<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2719} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. It is well-suited for all types of outdoor surfaces, making it a popular choice for skips. This bowl is only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, and it can be difficult to find on second-hand marketplaces like eBay. If you're interested in this bowl, it's best to purchase it new from a reputable dealer.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowl is a mid-biased bowl that is perfect for both indoor and outdoor play. It is highly versatile and can be used on a wide range of surfaces and conditions. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and can also be found on online secondhand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger lawn bowl is a wide biased bowl, making it ideal for outdoor greens and avoiding it indoors. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowl is a mid-biased bowl that suits both indoor rinks and outdoor greens. While the Tiger is one of the widest bowls in the Henselite range, the PRO-50 sits between the D-TEC and the XP in the Drakes Pride range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the bias of these lawn bowls differs with the Tiger being more suited for outdoor use, while the PRO-50 can be used in both indoor and outdoor settings. </p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offer an embedded grip option. This grip style is set deeper into the bowl and can benefit bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. The Henselite Tiger comes with the Heneslite Mega grip as standard, while the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offers their own embedded grip option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the dimple grip is a classic style of grip that features small divots along the shoulder of the bowl. This provides better grip for your fingertips. While the Henselite Tiger does not offer this grip style, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 does not advertise it as an option either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Henselite Tiger and Drakes Pride PRO-50 offer excellent grip options to suit different bowlers' needs. The embedded grip is particularly helpful for those who struggle with gripping the bowl, while the dimple grip provides a classic style for those who prefer it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Henselite Tiger and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowls, it's clear that the Henselite Tiger is the more expensive option. A brand new Tiger will set you back around £400, while a second-hand version can be found for anywhere between £200-690. On the other hand, a new Drakes Pride PRO-50 will cost around £300, and a second-hand version can be found for between £190-260.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the prices of both the Tiger and the PRO-50 can vary depending on whether you're buying new or used, it's evident that the Henselite option is the more costly of the two. However, it's worth noting that the price difference isn't significant enough to make a major impact on the overall quality of the product. Both bowls are popular choices among lawn bowlers and offer excellent performance on the green, regardless of their price point. Ultimately, the decision between the two models will come down to personal preference, rather than cost.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Depending on your playing style and preferences, either the Henselite Tiger or the Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowl could be the ideal choice for you. The Henselite Tiger is a great option for outdoor players who prefer a wide biased bowl, while it may not suit indoor surfaces as well. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offers a mid-bias and is versatile enough to perform well on both indoor and outdoor surfaces. Therefore, if you mainly play indoor bowls, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 would best suit your needs. But for outdoor lawn bowling players who want a bowl that offers a much wider arc, the Henselite Tiger would be the way to go.</p>
