<p>In this post, I'll compare the specifications, bias, grip options, and price of each model to determine which one is the best fit for you. So, stick around until the end and you'll have a better idea of which lawn bowl suits your needs best.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid is a wide biased lawn bowl that is well-suited for outdoor play on a variety of surfaces. With sizes ranging from 00 to 5, it is available exclusively in the UK market. This bowl is ideal for skips and can often be found in secondhand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl, suitable for outdoor play on a variety of surfaces and conditions. Available in sizes 00 to 5, it is exclusively sold in the UK market and can be hard to find second-hand online. Overall, the Henselite Tiger EVO is a versatile and reliable choice for lawn bowlers looking for a mid-to-wide biased bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger EVO and Taylor Lignoid lawn bowls are designed for outdoor use and have a bias that favors certain directions when rolled. The Taylor Lignoid is wider biased than the Henselite Tiger EVO and is ideal for outdoor greens. It is suitable for all outdoor surfaces but it is advised to avoid using it if you predominately play indoors.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger EVO is a midbiased/wide biased bowl between Tiger Pro and the Tiger in the Henselite range. Like the Taylor Lignoid, it is ideal for outdoor greens, but is suitable for all outdoor surfaces including indoor play. While both lawn bowls have their respective biases, it ultimately comes down to a player's personal preference and playing style to determine which lawn bowl to use.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid and Henselite Tiger EVO lawn bowls have different grip options. The Taylor Lignoid comes with the Progrip, a dimple grip which is highly regarded. However, it does not have the option of an embedded grip. In contrast, the Henselite Tiger EVO has the embedded Henselite Mega grip as standard. This grip is deeper and can benefit bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the embedded grip has advantages, such as feeling smaller in the hand, the dimple grip is a classic design that is tried and tested. It provides small divots for the fingertips to sit in, giving the bowler a better grip. Ultimately, the choice of grip comes down to personal preference and which feels most comfortable to the bowler. Both the Taylor Lignoid and Henselite Tiger EVO have reputable grip options that will suit different bowlers’ needs.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the price comparison of the Taylor Lignoid and the Henselite Tiger EVO, it is clear that the latter is significantly more expensive. While the Taylor Lignoid can be purchased brand new for £290 or second-hand for around £90-£130, the Henselite Tiger EVO has a price tag of around £400 for a new set and second-hand sets can be found for £250-£300.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is important to note that the price difference may be due to the materials and manufacturing process used to produce the two models. The Henselite Tiger EVO is made with a high-density composite material, whereas the Taylor Lignoid is made with a denser resin material. Additionally, the Henselite Tiger EVO has a higher degree of customization options, making it a popular choice for competitive players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision on which model to purchase will depend on individual preferences and needs. While the Henselite Tiger EVO may be a more premium option, the Taylor Lignoid is a more affordable choice that still delivers quality performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are a lawn bowls enthusiast who mostly plays outdoors, then the Taylor Lignoid bowl would be the best fit for you. With its wide bias, it can help you master the outdoor surface better, improving control and accuracy. However, if you're someone who enjoys playing both indoors and outdoors, then you should stay away from this bowl, as it's not suitable for indoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, if you're someone who loves playing outdoors but also wants the flexibility to play indoors, then the Henselite Tiger EVO is an excellent choice for you. Its mid-bias design makes it easy to use on various surfaces, improving gameplay and overall control. Though primarily designed for outdoor play, the Tiger EVO can also be used indoors, making it a great all-rounder.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, when comparing the Taylor Lignoid and the Henselite Tiger EVO, both are suitable for outdoor play and come in sizes 00 to 5. However, the Henselite Tiger EVO offers more versatility and can be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions. Additionally, it may be difficult to find Henselite Tiger EVO bowls on second-hand marketplaces, whereas Taylor Lignoid bowls can be found on platforms such as eBay. Ultimately, the decision between the two models will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the player.</p>
