<p>In this blog post, I'll be comparing two of the most popular models - the Henselite Tiger TX and the Henselite Tiger II. We'll look at the specs, bias, grip options, price, and who each bowl is best suited for. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clearer idea of which bowl is the right choice for you. So let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2732} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX is a narrow-biased lawn bowl designed for indoor play, with a bias that suits fast outdoor greens as well. Available in UK sizes 00 to 5, this model is highly sought after and can be difficult to find second-hand online. Ideal for indoor bowlers and those playing in the lead position on outdoor greens, the Henselite Tiger TX is a high-quality bowl that is worth investing in.</p>

<p>The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow bias lawn bowl designed for indoor play and fast outdoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers and those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5 and is only available in the UK market. It may be difficult to find the bowl on secondhand marketplaces, such as eBay, so purchasing a brand new set may be necessary.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger II and Tiger TX are narrow biased lawn bowls, designed for use in indoor rinks. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2835} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger TX is the narrowest biased bowl in the Henselite range and is ideal for indoor play, but should be avoided if you primarily play outdoors in the UK. Meanwhile, the Tiger II sits between the Tiger TX and Tiger Pro in terms of bias, and is suitable for both indoor and lead outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while both bowls have similar narrow bias characteristics, the Tiger II has slightly more versatility with its ability to perform well in both indoor and fast outdoor greens. The Tiger TX, on the other hand, may be limiting for those who primarily play outdoors or in non-indoor settings. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the choice between the two bowls will depend on individual playing style and preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger TX and the Henselite Tiger II come with the Henselite Mega grip as standard, which is an embedded grip. This grip is deeper on the Tiger TX, making it feel smaller in the hand, which can benefit bowlers who struggle with grip. On the other hand, the Tiger II has a classic dimple grip that allows fingertips to sit in the dimples, providing a better grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two models may come down to personal preference and hand size. Bowlers who struggle with grip may prefer the Tiger TX, while those who prefer a classic dimple grip may opt for the Tiger II. It’s important for bowlers to try out both models and determine which one feels most comfortable and provides the best grip for their specific needs.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger TX and the Henselite Tiger II have similar price points when purchased brand new, with both models costing around £420. However, there is a significant difference in price when purchasing these models second hand. The Henselite Tiger TX can be bought for around £260-310, while the Henselite Tiger II can be bought for around £200-290.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's worth noting that the price of a second-hand lawn bowl can vary depending on its condition and any additional included accessories. Nonetheless, for those looking for a more budget-friendly option, the Henselite Tiger II may be the better choice when buying second hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while the prices of these two models are similar when purchased brand new, the Henselite Tiger II comes out as the more affordable option when purchasing second hand. Whether you opt for the Tiger TX or Tiger II will depend on your personal preferences and playing style.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger TX and Tiger II are narrow biased bowls ideal for indoor play, with the latter also suitable for faster outdoor surfaces. However, the TX is best suited for indoor bowlers who primarily play the lead position, while the Tiger II is well-suited for those who frequently play lead but may also play other positions on various surfaces. If you're an indoor bowler who loves playing lead and prefers a bowl that's highly accurate, the Tiger TX could be the perfect choice for you. But if you want a bowl that can be used in a wider range of scenarios, including faster outdoor surfaces, the Tiger II is your best bet. Ultimately, your decision may come down to personal preference, so it's important to try out both options before making a final choice.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Henselite Tiger TX and the Henselite Tiger II are narrow biased bowls that are ideal for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. However, the Tiger II is more versatile, as it can also be used on fast outdoor greens, making it a better option for those who play in various conditions. While both bowls are only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, they can be difficult to find on online secondhand marketplaces, so buying them new may be the only option. Ultimately, the choice between the two models will come down to personal preference and the specific needs of the bowler.</p>
