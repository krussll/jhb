<p>In this blog post, I'm going to compare two popular models - the Aero Sonic and the Drakes Pride Professional. I'll be looking at the specifications of each bowl, the bias, grip options, the price, and who the bowls are best suited for. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clearer understanding of which bowl is the best fit for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2735} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Sonic lawn bowl is designed for outdoor use, with a wide bias that makes it particularly suitable for skips. It is available in sizes ranging from 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. While it may be difficult to find second-hand options, new Aero Sonic bowls can be purchased online or through authorized dealers.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride Professional is a flexible lawn bowl, well-suited for both outdoor and indoor play. It offers a mid-biased design, making it ideal for players needing a moderate amount of precision. This model is easy to use on any surface and is available in an extensive range of sizes. Additionally, it is relatively easy to find online, even as a second-hand item.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of the Drakes Pride Professional and the Aero Sonic lawn bowls is that the Sonic is wider biased than the Professional. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2833} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This means that the Sonic will turn more in its trajectory than the Professional. The Sonic is also recommended for outdoor greens, while the Professional is suitable for both indoor and outdoor surfaces. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Sonic may be better for bowlers who want a wider arc in their shot while the Professional may be better for those who want a more controlled and consistent trajectory. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2809} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two lawn bowls will depend on the preferences and skill level of the individual bowler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grip options, the Aero Sonic has a clear advantage over the Drakes Pride Professional. Aero offers multiple grip options including embedded, dimple, and non-gripped, all at no extra cost. This means that bowlers can choose the grip that feels most comfortable for their individual style of play. In contrast, Drakes Pride only offers the Professional with their standard dimple grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it is worth noting that an embedded grip can be beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. This is because the embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, which can make it feel smaller in the hand and easier to grip. On the other hand, the dimple grip is a classic style of grip where small divots run along the shoulder of the bowl. The idea is for the fingertips to sit in these dimples for a better grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Aero Sonic's variety of grip options gives it an edge over the Drakes Pride Professional. However, bowlers who struggle with grip may find the embedded grip of the Drakes Pride Professional more comfortable. Ultimately, the best choice will depend on the individual bowler's preferences and needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of pricing, the Aero Sonic is generally more expensive than the Drakes Pride Professional. The Aero Sonic can be purchased new for around £400, whereas the Drakes Pride Professional is priced at around £290 new. Second-hand purchases of the Aero Sonic can still be quite expensive at around £300-£360, while the Drakes Pride Professional can be found for a much lower price range of £60-£210.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Aero Sonic may be more expensive, it is important to note that it comes with certain features and technologies that may make it worth the investment. However, for those on a budget or just starting out, the Drakes Pride Professional may be a more affordable option that still delivers quality performance. Ultimately, the decision between the two models will depend on individual preferences, priorities, and budget.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When deciding between the Aero Sonic and the Drakes Pride Professional, it ultimately depends on the individual's preferences and needs. The Aero Sonic would be best for those who exclusively play outdoor bowls and want versatility in their positions. It is also an excellent option for those who prefer a more straightforward and subdued design.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride Professional is an all-around bowl that can suit both indoor and outdoor surfaces. It is ideal for those who want a mid-biased bowl for enhanced accuracy and control. Additionally, the Professional has an eye-catching and colorful design that stands out on the green.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, the choice between the Aero Sonic and the Drakes Pride Professional comes down to what the player values most. If outdoor play and versatility are essential, the Aero Sonic is an excellent option. However, if a bowl that can perform on any surface and has a more colorful design is desired, then the Drakes Pride Professional is the way to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Aero Sonic and the Drakes Pride Professional are excellent choices for lawn bowls players. The Aero Sonic is best suited for outdoor play and is available only as a new purchase. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride Professional is more versatile and can be used both indoors and outdoors. Additionally, it can be found second-hand on online marketplaces such as eBay. Ultimately, the decision between these two models will depend on the player's individual preferences and needs.</p>
