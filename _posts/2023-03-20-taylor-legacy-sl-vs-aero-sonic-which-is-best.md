<p>In this blog post, I will be comparing two popular models - the Taylor Legacy SL and the Aero Sonic. We'll explore the spec, bias, grip options, price, and even who each bowl is best suited for. By the time you finish reading this guide, you'll have a clear idea of which bowl will work best for you. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL is a wide biased outdoor lawn bowl, designed for use by skips on a variety of outdoor surfaces. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and can be purchased second hand on websites such as eBay. Its wide bias makes it a great choice for players who need a bowl that will stay on course in changing outdoor conditions.</p>

<p>The Aero Sonic is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. With its versatility, it's suitable for all outdoor surfaces and ideal for skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, the Aero Sonic can be challenging to find on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. As a result, it's recommended to purchase them new for the best performance.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Aero Sonic and Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowls have a bias that makes them ideal for outdoor greens, but the Taylor Legacy SL is considered a wide-biased bowl compared to the mid to wide-bias of the Aero Sonic. The Taylor Legacy SL is better suited for outdoor surfaces and is not recommended for indoor play, while the Aero Sonic is suitable for all outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL is positioned between the International and the Lignoid in the Taylor range, while the Aero Sonic is the widest bowl in the Aero range. Both bowls are well-designed for outdoor greens but have a slight difference in bias that could affect the player's performance. In summary, the Taylor Legacy SL is more suitable for a wide range of outdoor surfaces, while the Aero Sonic's bias is better for more specific outdoor surfaces.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grips, the Aero Sonic offers more options than the Taylor Legacy SL. With the Aero Sonic, bowlers can choose between a dimple, embedded grip, or no grip at all, all at no extra cost. In contrast, the Taylor Legacy SL only comes with the standard Taylor Progrip, which is a dimple grip. However, it is worth noting that the Taylor Legacy SL does not offer an embedded grip option, which can be beneficial for those struggling with gripping the bowl properly.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in hand. This can help people who struggle with gripping a standard size bowl. On the other hand, a dimple grip, like the one on the Taylor Legacy SL, features small divots or dimples that run along the shoulder of the bowl. This allows the fingertips to sit in the dimples for a better grip. Overall, while both the Aero Sonic and Taylor Legacy SL offer good grips, the Aero Sonic's wide range of grip options set it apart.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Taylor Legacy SL is the more affordable option with a new set starting at £290 and a second-hand set costing between £100 and £160. On the other hand, the Aero Sonic is a more expensive option, with a new set costing around £400 and a second-hand set ranging between £300 and £360.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Taylor Legacy SL offers a great value for money option for beginners and experienced bowlers alike, the Aero Sonic's higher price point may be justified by its advanced technology, design and responsiveness on the green. Ultimately, the choice between the two models will depend on the level of expertise of the player and their budget.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL and the Aero Sonic are both popular models of lawn bowls, but they have different strengths that make them better suited for different players. The Taylor Legacy SL is a wide biased bowl that is best for outdoor play, making it ideal for players who exclusively play outdoors. On the other hand, the Aero Sonic is a highly versatile outdoor bowl that can be used in multiple positions within a team, making it a great option for players who want versatility in their game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are looking for a reliable outdoor bowl that will perform well in a variety of conditions, then the Taylor Legacy SL is a great choice. Its wide bias ensures that it stays on course even in windy conditions, making it a reliable option for outdoor play. However, if you want a bowl that can adapt to different positions within your team, then the Aero Sonic is the way to go. Its flexibility makes it a popular choice for players who value versatility and adaptability in their game.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Taylor Legacy SL and the Aero Sonic will depend on your playing style and preferences. If you value reliability and consistency in your game, then the Taylor Legacy SL is the better option. But if you want a bowl that can adapt to different positions within your team, then the Aero Sonic is the way to go.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Aero Sonic and Taylor Legacy SL are great options for lawn bowls, with similar features such as wide bias and suitability for outdoor play on all surfaces. However, if availability and price are a concern, the Taylor Legacy SL may be a better choice as they can be found on second hand marketplaces like eBay. On the other hand, if you prefer to purchase new bowls, the Aero Sonic is a top-of-the-line option worth considering. Ultimately, the choice between the two will come down to personal preference and individual needs.</p>
