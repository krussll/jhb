<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hand signals are a common sight on bowls greens around the world. However, the can be confusing for new bowlers, especially as many just assume knowledge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are a new bowler, this guide should give you a good understanding of the basic hand signals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href="#what-are-hand-signals-in-lawn-bowls"></a>What are hand signals in lawn bowls?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hand signals are a bit like sign language to describe lawn bowls. They are used throughout the course of a game to describe what is happening, and what you would like to happen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This can include the state of the head (who is winning and by how many), what shot you should play (forehand, backhand, what weight), as well as feedback on your last delivery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href="#when-are-hand-signals-used"></a>When are hand signals used?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hand signals are often used by a skip to help whoever is bowling. They can be used to tell a player what sort of shot to play or to inform them if they are in a winning position or a losing one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They are often used just before, or just after you have taken a shot. It is very rare for hand signals to be used when communicating with a player who is not on the mat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href="#why-use-hand-signals"></a>Why use hand signals?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why use hand signals in the first place? Why not talk? There are several reasons, some are out of courtesy, and others may give you a slight competitive advantage. Here are the top 5 reasons why hand signals are used.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Voices cannot be heard over the sounds of road and air traffic.</li><li>Shouting disturbs players on the other rinks.</li><li>Your team will feel more in sync if you can read each other’s signals.</li><li>Signals will help communication and the flow of the game.</li><li>You can signal without drawing the attention of your opponents to certain situations.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are restrictions on when you can use hand signals. Whilst these are rarely enforced, it’s best to follow them for the sanity of those around!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>You can ONLY communicate with your team when you have possession of the mat.</li><li>Give information (especially the Vice) ONLY when asked for.</li></ol>

<p>In this guide, we will assume the bowler is right-handed. Any signal that indicates forehand or backhand will be reversed for a lefty.</p>

<p>This is used to inform a bowler you would like them to aim for a spot that isn’t the jack. This could be used as a tactic to cover bad positions or to pre-empt the jack moving to a particular spot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You do this signal by placing your foot sideways next to the aiming spot.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This signal is to indicate that two bowls (or a bowl and the jack) are touching. The bowls cannot be separated by the naked eye.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To do this signal make your hands into fists and push them together in front of you.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes the jack can be hidden from view for the bowler. If they ask you where the jack is, then perform this signal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To do this signal open up your hand, palm facing the bowler and put it above the jack, to indicate where it is.</p>

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a bowler, it can be tricky to get a sense of depth. It is common to ask the distance between the jack and a bowl. Let the bowler know where the bowl is in relation to the jack by using this signal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Open both palms. Imagine the left hand is the jack, and the right hand is the bowl in question. Space your hands accordingly to give the bowler an idea of the distance between them (e.g. move your hands closer together to indicate the jack and the bowl are close).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Jack high</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="/img/posts/jack-high.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-544"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack high is when a bowl is bowled with perfect weight and the bowl stops perpendicular to the jack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hand signal for this is to swing your arm in from of you body and waist height - almost as if you are drawing a line on the ground with a stick.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are asked which bowl is shot, and you are unsure, you will want to let the bowler know it would require a measure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You do this by extending your arms wide in front of you. Like you are pulling an imaginary measure.</p>
