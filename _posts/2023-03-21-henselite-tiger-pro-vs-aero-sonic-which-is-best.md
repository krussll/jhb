<p>Together, we will compare their specifications, bias, grip options, price and who each bowl would be best suited for. Trust me, by the end of this guide, you'll be able to confidently choose the best bowl for your lawn bowling experience.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2726} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro is a high-end lawn bowl designed with a mid-bias ideal for both indoor and outdoor play. Its versatile design makes it suitable for bowlers who play on various surfaces. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only in the UK market. The Henselite Tiger Pro is difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces and should ideally be purchased new. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that it is one of the most expensive lawn bowls on the market.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Sonic lawn bowl is a wide biased option designed for outdoor play, with suitability across a range of surfaces and particular strength in supporting skip players. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5 on the UK market only, making it a bit more exclusive than some other options. However, new purchases may be necessary due to the bowl's relative rarity on the secondhand market.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of bias, the Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased lawn bowl, while the Aero Sonic is categorized as either mid-biased or wide-biased. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2798} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both bowls are designed for outdoor use, but the Tiger Pro is considered suitable for indoor rinks as well. The Tiger Pro falls between the Tiger and Tiger II models in terms of level of bias, making it a versatile option for all-year-round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Aero Sonic is the widest bowl in the Aero range, making it ideal for outdoor greens and all outdoor surfaces. While the Sonic may not be as versatile as the Tiger Pro in terms of indoor play, its wider bias may provide an advantage on outdoor greens with varying surface conditions. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the bias of both lawn bowls caters to different playing preferences and environments, allowing bowlers to choose the best option for their needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grip options, the Aero Sonic lawn bowl comes out on top compared to the Henselite Tiger Pro. Aero offers a wide range of grip options, including a dimple, embedded grip, and a non-gripped option. All these grips come as standard and don't cost anything extra. In contrast, the Henselite Tiger Pro comes with the Henselite Mega grip, which is an embedded grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One advantage of an embedded grip like the Henselite Mega grip is that it sits deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand. This can be beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. On the other hand, a dimple grip like the one offered by Aero is a classic style that has small divots or dimples running along the bowl's shoulder. These dimples allow your fingertips to sit in them, providing a better grip for your bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both models have unique strengths in their grip options. While the Aero Sonic offers more diverse choices, the Henselite Tiger Pro provides an excellent embedded grip option that could benefit certain bowlers. Ultimately, choosing the right model for you will depend on your personal preferences and needs as a bowler.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, both the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Aero Sonic lawn bowls are almost identical. A brand new set of either bowl can cost around £400, with the second-hand price for both ranging between £250-£360. It's worth noting that purchasing a second-hand set could save you some money, but it's important to thoroughly examine the condition of the bowls before making a purchase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, when deciding between the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Aero Sonic, price doesn't need to be a major consideration. Both bowls are similarly priced and offer professional-level quality. The deciding factor may come down to personal preferences, such as feel, style, or additional features.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro and the Aero Sonic are both great lawn bowls, but they are suited to different types of players. The Tiger Pro is a dual-purpose bowl that can be played both indoors and outdoors. This makes it ideal for players who participate in both types of games and want a bowl that can perform well in multiple positions in a team. On the other hand, the Aero Sonic is an outdoor bowl that is specifically designed for outdoor play. It is perfect for players who only participate in outdoor games and want a bowl that can perform well in all positions in a team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of design, the Tiger Pro and Aero Sonic have significant differences. The Tiger Pro has a distinct bias, which means it has a curve that helps it to turn towards the jack. This makes it easier to aim and control, but also means it may not be ideal for straighter shots. The Aero Sonic, on the other hand, has a more symmetrical design, which makes it suitable for both straight and curved shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Aero Sonic will depend on the type of games you play and your specific playing style. If you participate in both indoor and outdoor games or are looking for a bowl that can perform well in multiple positions, the Tiger Pro may be the best choice. If you only play outdoor games and want a bowl that can perform well in all positions, the Aero Sonic may be the better option.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Aero Sonic and the Henselite Tiger Pro are high-quality lawn bowls that cater to different playing styles and surfaces. While the Tiger Pro is a versatile mid-biased bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play, the Aero Sonic is a wide-biased bowl perfect for outdoor surfaces, especially for skilled skips. However, both bowls come in limited sizes for the UK market and are difficult to find second hand. In terms of price, the Tiger Pro is significantly more expensive, but for serious bowlers looking to invest in top-of-the-line equipment, either bowl could be a great choice. Ultimately, the decision between the two will depend on individual preferences and playing style.</p>
