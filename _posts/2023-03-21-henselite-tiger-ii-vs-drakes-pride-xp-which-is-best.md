<p>I will be looking at the spec of the bowls, the bias, grip options, price, and who the bowls are best for. By the end of this post, you'll have a better idea of which bowl would suit you best. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2728} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow biased lawn bowl that is well-suited for indoor and fast outdoor play. With sizes available from 00 to 5 (for the UK market), it is best for indoor bowlers and those who play lead on quick outdoor greens. However, it can be difficult to find second-hand, so purchasing a new set may be necessary. Overall, the Henselite Tiger II is a solid option for those in search of a narrow biased bowl.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride XP is a wide biased lawn bowl that is best suited for outdoor play on a variety of surfaces. This bowl is particularly well-suited for skips and is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. It can be difficult to find second-hand Drakes Pride XP bowls online, so purchasing them new may be necessary.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II and the Drakes Pride XP are both lawn bowls with different biases. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2831} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger II is a narrow biased bowl, making it ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens, and is suitable for indoor and lead outdoor bowlers. Meanwhile, the XP is a wide biased bowl, making it the widest bowl in the Drakes Pride range and ideal for all outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparison, the Tiger II seems to be more focused on indoor and fast outdoor games with its narrow bias, while the XP is better suited for outdoor play with its wide bias. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2801} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, choosing between the two will depend on the player's preferences and the surface they will be playing on.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II and the Drakes Pride XP have different grip styles. The Henselite Tiger II comes with an embedded grip, known as the Heneslite Mega grip. This grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the hand and helping bowlers who struggle with grip. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP only offers its standard dimple grip, which features small divots that allow for better finger tip grip.</p>

<p>Both grip styles have their advantages, with the embedded grip of the Henselite Tiger II helping bowlers with grip issues and the classic dimple grip of the Drakes Pride XP allowing for better finger tip grip. Ultimately, the preference for grip style may vary from bowler to bowler and should be considered when choosing between these two popular models of lawn bowls.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, there is a noticeable difference between the Henselite Tiger II and the Drakes Pride XP lawn bowls. The Tiger II is more expensive, with a new set costing around £420 and second-hand sets costing between £200-£290. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is more affordable, with a new set costing around £290 and second-hand sets ranging from £140-£250.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the price difference might seem inconsequential, it can make a significant difference in the budget of someone looking to buy a new set of lawn bowls. If you are someone who wants to invest in a more expensive set for the long-term, the Henselite Tiger II might be the right choice for you. However, if you want to keep your budget in mind and still get a quality set of lawn bowls, the Drakes Pride XP might be the better option. Ultimately, the decision comes down to personal preference and budget.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are an indoor bowler who plays lead, then the Henselite Tiger II is the bowl for you. Its narrow bias is designed for indoor surfaces but can also be used on faster outdoor surfaces. On the other hand, if you are an outdoor bowler, the Drakes Pride XP with its wider bias is the perfect choice. However, it is important to note that the Drakes Pride XP should be avoided if you play indoors with its focus on outdoor play. Both bowls offer unique qualities, but it ultimately comes down to personal preference and the surface you play on.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Drakes Pride XP and Henselite Tiger II are popular lawn bowls with their own unique strengths. The Drakes Pride XP is a wide biased bowl ideal for outdoor play, and is suited for all outdoor surfaces and skips. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger II is a narrow biased bowl, ideal for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. While both bowls are only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, they can be difficult to find on online second hand marketplaces such as eBay, so it may be necessary to purchase them brand new. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on individual player preferences and the specific conditions of the greens they will be playing on.</p>
