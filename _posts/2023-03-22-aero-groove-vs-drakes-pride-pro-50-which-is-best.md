<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2703} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero GrooVe is a mid-biased lawn bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It is versatile and can be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only in the UK market. It may be difficult to find second hand Aero GrooVe bowls online, so purchasing them new is recommended.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 is a mid-biased lawn bowl that is suitable for indoor and outdoor play. It is a versatile bowl that can be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only and can be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay. Overall, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 is a reliable and adaptable lawn bowl.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Aero GrooVe and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 are mid-biased lawn bowls that are suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Aero GrooVe is positioned between the Quantum and the Sonic in the Aero range, while the PRO-50 is between the D-TEC and the XP in the Drakes Pride range. Additionally, the GrooVe is described as ideal for indoor rinks and outdoor greens, while the PRO-50 is ideal for both indoor and outdoor use.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another significant difference between the two bowls is their design. The GrooVe has a unique groove pattern that promotes a stable rolling trajectory, while the PRO-50 has a deeper grip, which allows bowlers to maintain better control of the bowl. Ultimately, the choice between the two bowls may come down to personal preference and the specific conditions in which they will be used.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grip options for lawn bowls, the Aero GrooVe clearly has more to offer. With a variety of grips available, including a dimple grip and an embedded grip, bowlers can choose the option that feels best in their hand. Moreover, all grip options come as standard with no additional cost, making it a great value for money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 only offers an embedded grip option. While this type of grip is helpful for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly, it may not provide as much versatility as options offered by Aero.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, while the Drakes Pride PRO-50 may be a good option for those needing extra help with their grip, the Aero GrooVe provides more options at no extra cost. Ultimately, the choice between these two popular models will depend on an individual bowler's preferences and needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Aero GrooVe is generally more expensive than the Drakes Pride PRO-50. New Aero GrooVe sets can cost around £400, while a new set of PRO-50s will run you around £300. Even secondhand, the Aero GrooVe tends to be pricier, with secondhand sets being sold between £300-£360, while a used set of PRO-50's can be found for a more affordable price of around £190-£260.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to note, however, that the price difference between the two models may vary depending on where you purchase them. Different retailers may offer different prices, and there may be other factors that influence the cost, such as whether or not the bowls come with a warranty or other accessories. Ultimately, the choice between the two models may come down to your budget and personal preference.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero GrooVe is a great choice for those looking to play indoors and outdoors, as it is a dual-purpose bowl. It also offers great flexibility in terms of team positions. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 is a mid-biased bowl that can be used on different surfaces both indoors and outdoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are someone who plays in varied environments and wants versatility, the Aero GrooVe would be a great option for you. However, if you are looking for mid-biased bowls that work well in both indoor and outdoor settings, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 would be a great fit. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on your specific needs and preferences as a lawn bowler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Aero GrooVe and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 are great options for lawn bowling enthusiasts. Both models are mid-biased and usable on a variety of surfaces and conditions. However, if you are looking for a bowl that can be purchased second-hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 may be the better option as they can often be found on online marketplaces like eBay. Ultimately, the decision between these two models may come down to personal preference and availability in your local market.</p>
