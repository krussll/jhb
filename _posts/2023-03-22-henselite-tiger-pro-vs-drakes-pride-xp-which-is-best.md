<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2726} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro lawn bowl is a mid-biased bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play, making it versatile for bowlers who play on a variety of surfaces. Available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market only, this bowl is known for its relatively rare availability on second-hand marketplaces such as eBay, making it challenging to find used. Moreover, the Henselite Tiger Pro is considered one of the most expensive bowls on the market.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride XP lawn bowl is a wide biased bowl designed for outdoor play on all surfaces, making it the go-to choice for skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market, these bowls are highly sought after and difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces. It is advisable to purchase these bowls new. Overall, the Drakes Pride XP is a high-quality and reliable option for outdoor lawn bowling.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2798} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of bias, the Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased bowl and is suitable for both indoor and outdoor greens. It is best for bowlers who play all year round. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is a wide-biased bowl and is best for outdoor greens. It is suitable for all outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while both bowls have different biases and ideal playing surfaces, they are recommended for different types of bowlers and playing conditions. The Henselite Tiger Pro is recommended for all-year-round players, while the Drakes Pride XP is best suited for outdoor players. </p>

<p>Therefore, when choosing between these two bowls, players should consider their preferred playing surface and frequency of play.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro features an embedded grip known as the Henselite Mega grip. This grip is set deeper into the bowl, which can help bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP comes with a classic dimple grip. This grip has small divots along the shoulder of the bowl, providing the bowler with a better grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the embedded grip of the Henselite Tiger Pro can make the bowl feel smaller in the hand, it may provide a more secure grip for some bowlers. The dimple grip of the Drakes Pride XP, however, offers a traditional design that many bowlers find comfortable and reliable. Ultimately, the choice between these grips may come down to personal preference and the unique needs of each individual bowler.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Henselite Tiger Pro is definitely on the higher end of the spectrum. Brand new, it costs around £400, which may be a deterrent for some buyers. However, if you're willing to search for a second-hand set, you could save some money and expect to pay around £250-£300.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is more affordable, with a brand new set costing around £290. Second-hand sets can be even more of a bargain, ranging from £140-£250. If you're looking for a cost-effective option without compromising on quality, the Drakes Pride XP may be the way to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between these two models will depend on your personal preferences and budget. While the Henselite Tiger Pro may be the more expensive option, its reputation for performance and durability may make it worth the investment for serious bowlers. But for those who are just starting out or looking to save some money, the Drakes Pride XP offers a quality option at a more affordable price point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro and the Drakes Pride XP are two popular models of lawn bowls, but they each have their unique strengths and are better suited to different types of players. The Henselite Tiger Pro is a dual purpose bowl, making it ideal for those who want to play both indoors and outdoors. Its versatility allows it to be played in multiple positions in a team, making it a great choice for anyone looking for a reliable all-rounder bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is a wide biased bowl aimed at those who play solely outdoors. While it may not be suitable for indoor play, the XP's wider bias makes it a great choice for outdoor conditions, particularly on heavier or slower greens. Its ability to cut through wind and hold its line makes it a favorite among experienced outdoor players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Drakes Pride XP comes down to personal preference and the type of conditions you will be playing in. If you're looking for a bowl that can handle a range of different surfaces and positions, the Tiger Pro is the way to go. But if you're an outdoor player looking for a bowl that can power through tough conditions, the XP is your best bet.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Henselite Tiger Pro and Drakes Pride XP have their own unique features and benefits. The Henselite Tiger Pro is ideal for those who play on a range of surfaces and the mid-bias makes it suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. However, it is one of the most expensive bowls on the market and can be hard to find second-hand. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is a wide-bias bowl that is best suited for outdoor play on all surfaces and is particularly well-suited to skips. It is also only available in the UK market and can be difficult to find second-hand. Ultimately, the choice between these two models may come down to personal preference and playing style.</p>
