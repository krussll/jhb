<p>In this blog post, I'll be comparing two popular models of lawn bowls - the Taylor Legacy SL and the Henselite Tiger Pro. I will thoroughly look into the specifications, bias, grip options, price, and guide you to decide which one would be the ideal fit for you. By the end of this guide, you can feel confident in selecting the right lawn bowl for your gameplay.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL is a wide biased lawn bowl designed specifically for outdoor play. It is suitable for use on all outdoor surfaces and is particularly well-suited for skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, the Taylor Legacy SL features excellent weight distribution that allows for a smooth and stable delivery. Additionally, it can be found on second-hand marketplaces such as eBay. Overall, the Taylor Legacy SL is a strong choice for lawn bowlers who prioritize outdoor play and skips.</p>

<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It is designed for bowlers who play on different surfaces and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only. The bowl is quite expensive and is difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. It is recommended to purchase a new set.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Legacy SL and the Henselite Tiger Pro are lawn bowls with specific biases. The Legacy SL is wider biased, making it better suited for outdoor greens, while the Tiger Pro has a mid-bias, making it more versatile for both indoor and outdoor play. The Legacy SL is ideally suited for all outdoor surfaces, whereas the Tiger Pro is suitable for all bowlers, especially those who play year-round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two bowls will depend on individual preferences and playing styles. Bowlers who mainly play outdoors will likely find the Legacy SL more suitable, while those who play indoors and outdoors may prefer the flexibility of the Tiger Pro. Both bowls are well-regarded for their quality and performance, which means that whichever one is chosen, it will be a reliable choice for aspiring and seasoned bowlers alike.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of the Henselite Tiger Pro and Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowls, it's important to note that the Taylor Legacy SL comes standard with the Taylor Progrip, a dimple grip that offers excellent traction. However, the Taylor Legacy SL does not offer the option of an embedded grip, which is typically considered superior to dimple grips.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger Pro comes standard with the Henselite Mega grip, an embedded grip that sits deeper into the bowl and can make it feel smaller in your hand. This is beneficial for bowlers who struggle to grip the bowl properly. While a dimple grip is a classic style that many bowlers are familiar with, an embedded grip may offer better support for certain individuals.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Henselite Tiger Pro and Taylor Legacy SL will depend on personal preference and individual needs. Bowlers who prioritize a traditional grip may prefer the Taylor Legacy SL, while those who require more support may opt for the embedded grip of the Henselite Tiger Pro.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Taylor Legacy SL and the Henselite Tiger Pro have noticeable differences. The Taylor Legacy SL can be purchased brand new for £290, which is considerably lower than the Henselite Tiger Pro's price tag of £400. For those on a tight budget, the Taylor Legacy SL could be a more cost-effective option. Additionally, second-hand sets of the Taylor Legacy SL can be found for around £100-£160, which makes it an even more affordable choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger Pro's brand new price of £400 may seem steep to some, but it's important to note that this model is considered high-end and is designed for serious bowlers. If you're looking for the latest technology and design features in a lawn bowl, the Henselite Tiger Pro may be worth the investment. However, if you're willing to wait and search for a used set, you could save some money as they can be found for around £250-£300. Ultimately, when deciding between these two popular models, the price should be considered alongside other factors such as performance, grip and weight.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those who primarily play outdoors, the Taylor Legacy SL would be the better option due to its wide bias. However, it should be avoided if you play indoors. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger Pro is a versatile option that can be used for both indoor and outdoor play. Its dual purpose feature makes it ideal for those who want flexibility in their game and can be used in multiple positions within a team. Ultimately, the decision between the two will depend on individual preferences and playing habits.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Legacy SL and the Henselite Tiger Pro have their strengths and weaknesses. The Taylor Legacy SL is an excellent choice for outdoor play and is ideal for skips, while the Henselite Tiger Pro is versatile enough to be played on both indoor and outdoor surfaces. However, the Henselite Tiger Pro is considerably more expensive and harder to find on the second-hand market. Ultimately, the choice between these models will come down to personal preference, playing style, and budget. Bowlers should try out both options before making a final decision.</p>
