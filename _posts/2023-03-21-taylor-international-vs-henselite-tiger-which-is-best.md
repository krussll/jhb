<p>In this blog post, I will be comparing two leading lawn bowl models, the Taylor International and the Henselite Tiger, to help you make an informed decision. I will be discussing the specs, bias, grip options, price, and who each of the bowls is best suited for. By the end of this guide, you'll have a better sense of which lawn bowl would be perfect for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2706} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International is a versatile lawn bowl suitable for different playing surfaces and conditions. It offers a mid-to-wide bias, making it ideal for outdoor play. The bowl is available in various sizes ranging from 00 to 5 in the UK market only. Additionally, interested buyers can find the Taylor International on online second hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide-biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. It is suitable for all outdoor surfaces and is particularly well-suited for skips. The Tiger is only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, and as such may be difficult to find in online marketplaces like eBay. New purchase may be required.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2824} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger and Taylor International lawn bowls are ideal for outdoor greens and can be used on all outdoor surfaces. However, the Taylor International is midbiased/wide biased, whereas the Henselite Tiger is wide biased. The International is positioned between the Ace and the Legacy in the Taylor range, while the Tiger is the widest bowl in the Henselite range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The difference in bias may affect the gameplay, as midbiased bowls tend to be more versatile and suitable for a wider range of shots, while wide biased bowls can be better for specific shots like draw and trail. It's important to choose the bias that suits your playing style and the type of surface you play on. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2828} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Henselite Tiger and Taylor International lawn bowls have their strengths and weaknesses, and the bias is a crucial factor to consider when selecting a bowl.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of the Henselite Tiger and the Taylor International lawn bowls, one key difference is the type of grip offered. The Taylor International comes with a dimple grip called the Progrip, while the Henselite Tiger has an embedded grip called the Henselite Mega grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip sits deeper into the bowl, making the bowl feel smaller in the bowler's hand. This can be beneficial for those who have trouble gripping the bowl properly. On the other hand, a dimple grip provides small divots, or dimples, along the shoulder of the bowl, which allows the bowler's fingertips to sit in the dimples and achieve a better grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While an embedded grip may be beneficial for some, the Taylor International's Progrip is widely regarded as one of the best dimple grips available. Ultimately, the choice of grip will depend on a bowler's personal preferences and needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Taylor International and the Henselite Tiger, it's clear that the Taylor International is the more affordable option. A new set of Taylor Internationals can be purchased for £360, whereas a brand new set of Henselite Tigers will cost around £400. This price difference may not seem like much, but it can be a significant factor for those looking to purchase a quality set of lawn bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it's worth noting that the Henselite Tiger II can be significantly more expensive than the Taylor International when buying second hand. The Tiger II can range from £200-£690, whereas the Taylor International typically sells second hand for around £100-£190. If budget is a concern, it may be more cost-effective to consider purchasing a used set of Taylor Internationals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, both the Taylor International and the Henselite Tiger are high-quality options for lawn bowls. The decision between the two will ultimately come down to personal preference and budget. Those seeking a more affordable option may lean towards the Taylor International, whereas those looking for the latest and greatest may opt for the Henselite Tiger II.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International and Henselite Tiger are two popular models of lawn bowls. The Taylor International is a mid-biased bowl that can be played on all surfaces, while the Henselite Tiger is a wide biased bowl that is ideal for outdoor play. If you are a player who primarily plays outdoors, the Henselite Tiger may be the best option for you. However, if you play on all surfaces and want a versatile bowl, the Taylor International may be the more suitable choice. Ultimately, which one to choose will depend on personal preference and playing style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor International and the Henselite Tiger are excellent options for lawn bowls enthusiasts. They both have their own unique features and benefits, but ultimately it comes down to personal preference. The Taylor International is more readily available on second hand marketplaces and is a versatile bowl that can be used on a variety of surfaces. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger is ideal for all outdoor surfaces and is particularly suited to skips, but can be harder to find second hand. Ultimately, it is important to try out both models and ultimately make a decision based on your own preferences and needs.</p>
