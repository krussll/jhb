<p>The Taylor Lazer is a popular lawn bowl model that is designed for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. Its narrow bias makes it the narrowest biased bowl in the Taylor range, and it is ideal for indoor rinks and for bowlers who frequently play lead. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Lazer may not be the best choice for those who predominantly play outdoors in the UK.</p>

<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased bowl that is ideal for both indoor and outdoor play. It is a versatile bowl that is suitable for all bowlers, especially those who play on a variety of surfaces throughout the year. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro comes with the Henselite Mega grip as standard, which is an embedded grip that is considered to be better than a traditional dimple grip. This grip provides excellent control and feel, making the Tiger Pro a fantastic dual-purpose bowl that can be played in multiple positions on a team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Henselite Tiger Pro is an excellent choice for bowlers looking for a high-quality, versatile bowl that can be used on a variety of surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the biases of the Taylor Lazer and the Henselite Tiger Pro lawn bowls, it's important to note the different characteristics of each model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer is a narrow biased bowl, meaning it has a smaller bias than other models in the Taylor range. This makes it ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens where a more direct line to the jack is required. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it may not be the best choice for bowlers who predominantly play outdoors in the UK, as the narrow bias may be less effective on slower or heavier greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased bowl, meaning it has a medium-sized bias. It falls in between the popular Tiger and Tiger II models, offering a balanced bias that is suitable for all outdoor greens and indoor rinks. This makes it an excellent choice for bowlers who play all year round, as it can adapt to a variety of different conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while both the Taylor Lazer and the Henselite Tiger Pro are suitable for indoor rinks, the Tiger Pro offers a more versatile bias that can perform well in a wider range of outdoor conditions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowlers who play both indoors and outdoors may find the Tiger Pro to be the more suitable option, while those who primarily play indoors or on fast outdoor greens may prefer the more narrow bias of the Lazer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips on the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Taylor Lazer, it is clear that both have their unique advantages. The Henselite Tiger Pro comes with the Henselite Mega grip, which is an embedded grip that is considered to be more modern and better than traditional dimple grips. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This grip provides better control and a smoother release, making it ideal for bowlers who play on a variety of surfaces both indoors and outdoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Taylor Lazer comes with the Taylor Progrip, which is a dimple grip that is considered to be one of the best around. While it may not be as modern as the Henselite Mega grip, it is still a high-quality grip that provides excellent control and comfort. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Taylor Lazer have excellent grips that provide superior control and comfort. The Henselite Tiger Pro's embedded grip is more modern and better suited for those with grip issues, while the Taylor Lazer's dimple grip is still one of the best around. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two models will depend on the individual bowler's preferences and playing style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Henselite Tiger Pro would be a better choice for bowlers who play on a variety of surfaces both indoors and outdoors. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With its mid-bias and embedded grip, it provides the flexibility and durability necessary to perform well in all types of conditions. It is also suitable for all bowlers, regardless of their position on the team, and comes in a range of sizes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Taylor Lazer is more specialized for indoor play, and is best suited for bowlers who predominantly play indoors or lead on fast outdoor greens. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Its narrow bias and dimple grip make it ideal for fast greens, but less suitable for other surfaces. It is also more affordable than the Henselite Tiger Pro, making it a good option for those on a budget (more on that it a second!).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the price of the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Taylor Lazer, it's clear that the Henselite Tiger Pro is one of the most expensive bowls on the market. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At around £400 brand new, it's significantly more expensive than the Taylor Lazer, which can be purchased for £290 new. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it's worth noting that the Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play, so if you play all year round you certainly will get your monies worth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another factor to consider is the availability of these bowls on second-hand marketplaces. The Henselite Tiger Pro cannot be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay, which means that if you're looking to purchase a second-hand set, you may struggle to find them. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Taylor Lazer can be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay, with prices ranging from around £150-£170. This could be an important consideration for those who are on a budget or looking to save money on their lawn bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro and the Taylor Lazer are both lawn bowls, but they have some differences in their design and ideal use. The Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play on a variety of surfaces. It comes in sizes 00 to 5, and it is one of the most expensive bowls on the market. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bowl has the Henselite Mega grip as standard, which is an embedded grip that provides better traction than a traditional dimple grip. The Tiger Pro is a fantastic dual-purpose bowl that can be played in multiple positions on a team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the Taylor Lazer is a narrow-biased bowl that is ideal for indoor play, but it can also be used on fast outdoor greens. It comes in sizes 00 to 5 and has the Taylor Progrip as standard, which is a dimple grip that is one of the best around. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lazer is primarily aimed at indoor bowlers and is best suited for those who play lead a lot. The bowl is one of the narrowest biased bowls in the Taylor range, and it can be bought new for £290 or second-hand for around £150-£170.</p>
