<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the grips of the Henselite Tiger TX and the Drakes Pride XP lawn bowls, there are distinct differences. The Henselite Tiger TX comes with the Henselite Mega grip as standard, which is an embedded grip, while the Drakes Pride XP only offers their standard dimple grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand. This is beneficial for bowlers who struggle with grip, as the smaller feel can help them maintain proper grip and control. On the other hand, the dimple grip is a classic style of grip. It features small divots or dimples running along the shoulder of the bowl, which helps fingers sit in these dimples, providing a better grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between an embedded grip or a dimple grip comes down to individual preference and style of play. Bowlers should try out both grips to see which feels more comfortable and provides better control for their specific needs.</p>
