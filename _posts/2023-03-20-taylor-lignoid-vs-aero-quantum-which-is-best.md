<p>That's why I'm here to help you out! In this blog post, I'll be comparing two of the most popular lawn bowls in the market - the Taylor Lignoid and the Aero Quantum. We'll dive into the specs, bias, grip options, price, and which bowl suits whom the best. So, by the end of this guide, you'll have a better understanding of which bowl is perfect for you. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid lawn bowl is a wide biased model that is perfect for outdoor play, especially on any kind of surface. It is particularly suited for skips, making it an excellent choice for experienced players. The Lignoid is available in the UK market only and comes in sizes 00 to 5. While it may be a bit challenging to find new Lignoid bowls, they can be easily found on second-hand online marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum is a narrow biased lawn bowl that is ideal for indoor play and fast outdoor play. It is well-suited for indoor bowlers and those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. It is available in the UK market in sizes 00 to 5, but can be hard to find on online second-hand marketplaces. Ultimately, it may be necessary to purchase new if you're looking to get your hands on the Aero Quantum.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the Aero Quantum and the Taylor Lignoid lawn bowls lies in their bias. The Lignoid is a wide-biased bowl, while the Quantum is a narrow-biased bowl. This means that the Lignoid is designed to have a wider arc when rolling towards the jack, while the Quantum is designed to have a tighter arc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lignoid is ideal for outdoor greens, while the Quantum is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. The Lignoid also has a wider diameter and is considered one of the widest bowls in the Taylor range, while the Quantum is the narrowest bowl in the Aero range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Lignoid and the Quantum will depend on personal preference, playing conditions, and skill level. Players who prefer a wider arc and play mostly on outdoor greens may prefer the Lignoid, while those who prefer a tighter arc and play on both indoor and outdoor surfaces might opt for the Quantum.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the grips of the Aero Quantum and Taylor Lignoid lawn bowls, there are some notable differences. The Taylor Lignoid only comes with the Progrip, a dimple grip that is highly regarded. However, it does not offer the option of an embedded grip, which some bowlers may prefer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the Aero Quantum offers a wide range of grip options, including the dimple, embedded, and non-gripped options. What's more, all of these grips come as standard, without any additional cost. This makes the Aero Quantum a great choice for bowlers who need a bowl that fits their unique grip needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while the Taylor Lignoid has a great Progrip, the Aero Quantum offers more variety and options when it comes to grips. Plus, with its embedded grip option, the Aero Quantum can even help bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the price of lawn bowls, the Taylor Lignoid and the Aero Quantum are both on the higher end of the price spectrum. The Taylor Lignoid can be purchased new for £290, which is significantly less than the Aero Quantum's new price point of roughly £400. However, those looking for a second-hand set of bowls could save some money with the Taylor Lignoid, which can be found for around £90-130, whereas the Aero Quantum's second-hand price ranges from £300-£360.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, both models of lawn bowls come with a significant investment, but it may come down to personal preference and budget when deciding between the two. The Aero Quantum may offer some unique features that justify the higher price point, but the Taylor Lignoid could be a more affordable option for those looking to get started with lawn bowling.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid and the Aero Quantum are both popular models of lawn bowls, each with unique characteristics that make them suitable for different types of players. The Taylor Lignoid is a great option for those who exclusively play outdoors, as its wide bias and design work well in this environment. However, it may not be as effective indoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Aero Quantum is a narrow biased bowl that is well-suited for both indoor and outdoor play. It can be used by players in multiple positions during team play indoors and is particularly effective for lead bowlers when used outdoors. If versatility is important to you, the Aero Quantum may be the better choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between the two models will depend on individual preferences and playing style. To ensure you make the best selection, consider factors such as the type of environment you will be playing in and your position in team play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Lignoid and the Aero Quantum have their strengths and ideal playing conditions. The Taylor Lignoid is a wider biased bowl and better for outdoor play, while the Aero Quantum is a narrow biased bowl and better for indoor play or fast outdoor greens. Both models offer a range of sizes for UK players, though the Aero Quantum may be more difficult to find secondhand. Ultimately, the choice between the two models may come down to personal preference and the specific needs of the player.</p>
