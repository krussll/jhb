<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a popular lawn bowl model that is narrow biased, making it ideal for indoor and fast outdoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only and can sometimes be found on secondhand marketplaces like eBay. Overall, the Taylor Vector VS is a reliable choice for players looking for a narrow biased bowl.</p>

<p>The Taylor Lignoid is a lawn bowl model with a wide bias that is suitable for outdoor play on all surfaces. It is particularly useful for skips and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. If you are interested in this model, you may be able to find it on second-hand online marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the Taylor Lignoid and the Taylor Vector VS lawn bowl is the bias. The Lignoid has a wider bias, making it ideal for outdoor greens, while the Vector VS has a narrow bias and is more suitable for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. Additionally, the Vector VS is designed for indoor bowlers and lead outdoor bowlers, while the Lignoid is suitable for all outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between the two lawn bowls will depend on individual preferences and playing styles. Players who mostly play indoors or on fast outdoor greens may prefer the Vector VS, while those who play predominantly on outdoor greens may opt for the Lignoid. It is important to consider the bias of each bowl and choose the one that best suits your needs and preferences.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the grips of the Taylor Lignoid and the Taylor Vector VS lawn bowls, they are both equipped with the Taylor Progrip, which is known to be one of the best dimple grips on the market. However, neither of these bowls comes with the option of an embedded grip, which is preferred by some bowlers who have trouble grasping the bowl with ease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl than a dimple grip, which can make the bowl feel smaller in your hand. For some bowlers, this added depth can greatly improve grip and accuracy. On the other hand, a dimple grip is a classic and popular choice due to the small divots along the shoulder of the bowl, which give fingers a better grip. Ultimately, the choice between an embedded grip and a dimple grip comes down to individual preference and comfort while bowling.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, there is a notable difference between the Taylor Vector VS and the Taylor Lignoid lawn bowls. The Taylor Vector VS is generally more expensive than the Taylor Lignoid. In fact, a new Taylor Vector VS can cost as much as £360, while a new Taylor Lignoid can be bought for £290.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if you're on a budget, both models can also be purchased second hand. Second hand Taylor Vector VS bowls usually range from £160-£190, while second hand Taylor Lignoids are typically priced between £90-130. It's important to note that prices may vary based on the condition of the bowls and other factors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, if you're looking for a more affordable option, the Taylor Lignoid may be the way to go. However, if you're willing to invest in a more high-end and advanced model, the Taylor Vector VS may be worth the extra cost. Ultimately, the decision comes down to individual preferences, budget, and playing style.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS and the Taylor Lignoid are two popular models of lawn bowls, with distinct differences in their design and intended use. The Vector VS is a narrow biased bowl, perfect for indoor bowlers but can also be used on faster outdoor surfaces. This bowl is ideal for lead players who need more accuracy in their shots. On the other hand, the Lignoid is a wide biased bowl designed for outdoor use only. It is best suited for bowlers who need a lot of stability and control of their shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, who would benefit from using these bowls? If you mainly play indoors and need a bowl that is precise and accurate, then the Taylor Vector VS is the right choice for you. It is especially ideal for lead players who need to get their shots as close to the jack as possible. However, if you play only outdoors and need a bowl that provides maximum stability and control, then the Taylor Lignoid is the better choice. Its wide bias helps to keep the bowl on course in windy conditions, making it an ideal choice for outdoor bowlers.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the Taylor Lignoid and the Taylor Vector VS lawn bowls, it all comes down to personal preference and the type of play you prefer. If you're an indoor bowler or prefer fast outdoor play, the narrow biased Taylor Vector VS would be your best choice. On the other hand, if you enjoy playing outdoors on a variety of surfaces and are a skip, the wide biased Taylor Lignoid would be a better fit. Regardless of your preference, both models are available in sizes 00 to 5 and can be found on online marketplaces such as eBay.
