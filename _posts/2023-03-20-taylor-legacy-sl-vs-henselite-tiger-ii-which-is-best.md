<p>I'll be diving into the different specifications, bias, grip options, pricing, and who each bowl will work best for. You'll get all the information you need to make an informed decision and get the right bowl for you. Let's get started!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. It is suitable for all types of outdoor surfaces and is especially suited to players who take on the role of "skips". The Taylor Legacy SL comes in various sizes, ranging from 00 to 5, and is available exclusively for the UK market. Additionally, the Taylor Legacy SL can be found on online second-hand marketplaces, like eBay.</p>

<p>The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow bias lawn bowl best suited for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market and is ideal for indoor bowlers or those playing lead on fast outdoor greens. While it may be difficult to find second hand options, the Henselite Tiger II can be purchased brand new for those interested in its unique benefits.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of the Henselite Tiger II and the Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowl is that the Tiger II is narrow biased, while the Legacy SL is wide biased. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2811} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This means that the Tiger II will have less of a curve than the Legacy SL when delivered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the Taylor Legacy SL is more suitable for slow outdoor greens and all outdoor surfaces, while the Henselite Tiger II is better suited for indoor rinks and faster outdoor greens. The Tiger II is also recommended for lead outdoor bowlers, while the Legacy SL is not specified for any specific position.</p>

<p>Overall, bowlers should choose the lawn bowl that best suits the specific greens they will be playing on and their own personal preferences.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the grips of the Henselite Tiger II and the Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowls, there are some notable differences. The Taylor Legacy SL features the popular Taylor Progrip, a dimple grip that offers a reliable hold. While the Progrip is one of the best dimple grips available, it does not offer an embedded grip option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the Henselite Tiger II comes with the Heneslite Mega grip, an embedded grip that is set deeper into the bowl. This means the bowl feels smaller in your hand, which can be advantageous for bowlers who struggle with grip. While an embedded grip is generally considered superior to a dimple grip, the Progrip on the Taylor Legacy SL is still a highly effective option. Ultimately, the choice between these two models will come down to personal preference and playing style.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the price of the Taylor Legacy SL and the Henselite Tiger II lawn bowls, there is a notable difference. The Taylor Legacy SL is more affordable, with a new set costing around £290, and the second-hand options ranging from £100 to £160. Meanwhile, the Henselite Tiger II is a more expensive option, with the new set costing around £420 and the second-hand options ranging from £200 to £290.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the price difference may steer some bowlers towards the Taylor Legacy SL, it’s important to note that the price isn’t the only factor to consider when choosing a set of lawn bowls. The performance, durability, and overall quality of the bowl should also be taken into account. While the Henselite Tiger II may be more expensive, it is also known for its exceptional performance on the green. Ultimately, it’s important to consider your needs and budget when choosing between these two popular models of lawn bowls.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL and Henselite Tiger II are two popular models of lawn bowls that cater to different types of players. If you primarily play outdoors, the Taylor Legacy SL would be the better option due to its wide biased design. However, if you play mostly indoors and need a narrow biased bowl, the Henselite Tiger II is a great choice. Additionally, the Henselite Tiger II is ideal for lead players due to its narrow bias and versatility on faster outdoor surfaces. Ultimately, the decision between these two bowls will depend on your individual playing style and the environment you typically play in.</p>

<p>After considering the features and benefits of both bowls, it's clear that each model caters to different types of bowlers and playing conditions.
