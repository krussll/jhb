<h2>Spec</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow biased lawn bowl designed for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. It is recommended for indoor bowlers and those playing lead on fast outdoor greens. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, the Henselite Tiger II may be difficult to find second-hand, so purchasing new may be necessary.</p>

<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro is a high-end lawn bowl model that is mid-biased, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It is the perfect choice for bowlers who frequently switch between various surfaces. The bowl is available in the UK market in sizes ranging from 00 to 5, but it is a rare find in online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay. As one of the most expensive bowls in the market, the Henselite Tiger Pro is a top-of-the-line option for serious lawn bowlers.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II and the Henselite Tiger Pro both come with the Henselite Mega grip as standard. This grip features an embedded design, which makes the bowl feel smaller in your hand. This is beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger Pro does not offer a different grip option. This model also features the Henselite Mega grip with an embedded design. The Tiger Pro does not have a classic dimple grip like some other models.</p>

Both models have a brand new price tag of around £400-£420, while their second-hand prices range from £200-£300. However, it's worth noting that prices for second-hand lawn bowls can vary depending on the condition and usage of the bowls. Ultimately, the price difference between the two models might not be the determining factor for bowlers when considering which one to purchase.
