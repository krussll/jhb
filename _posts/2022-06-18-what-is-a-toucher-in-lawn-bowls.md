<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When people watch bowls for the first time - either on tv or in person - they all wonder "why are they spraying that bowl?". In short the bowl is marked because it is a "toucher".</p>

<p>But what is a toucher? And what does it mean for the rest of the game? In this guide I hope to explain everything you need to know about "touchers" in lawn bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What is a "toucher" in lawn bowls?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The term "toucher" refers to a bowl that touches the jack before it comes to rest after being delivered by the bowler.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is important to note, that the <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/lawn-bowls-rules/" data-type="post" data-id="304">rules of lawn bowls</a> state a toucher is only marked if the bowl comes into direct contact with the jack (i.e. it doesn't move the jack by knocking another bowl into it). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, a bowl can only be marked as a toucher on it's initial delivery (a bowler just bowled the bowl). Once it has stopped moving it can no longer become a toucher, even if another bowler knocks it on to the jack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A bowl is only marked as a toucher for the duration of the end, and any chalk marks must be rubbed off before the start of the next end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How do you mark a toucher in lawn bowls?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two most common ways to mark a toucher is by putting an "X" on it with a stick of chalk, or by spaying it with a special chalk spray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I first started the chalk sticks were pretty much the only way you saw a toucher being marked, however the sprays are far more convieniant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sprays allow you to mark the bowl without touching it. This is can be important, especially if the bowl stops on one of the edges, as marking it with a piece of chalk can be difficult without moving it, or knocking it over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sprays are also useful as they can be made in different colours. This was never a problem 10-15 years ago as most bowls were black, however with bowls now being bought in every colour combination you can think of its important to have a good contrast colour to make the toucher mark clear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Why are touchers important in lawn bowls?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, why are touchers marked in the first place? The main reason is in case the bowl ends up in the ditch at the back of the rink.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Normally, when a bowl ends up in the ditch it is considered out of play, and doesn't count when the end finishes. This is not the case for touchers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>When a toucher ends up in the ditch it is still live and can be included in the count.</p>

<p>For more information on this read my full guide on what happens when <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/lawn-bowls-rules-when-the-jack-is-in-the-ditch/" data-type="post" data-id="499">the jack is in the ditch</a> which covers several scenarios for when either the jack or a bowl ends up in the ditch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Touchers are an important part of the game of bowls. The benefit of keeping a bowl live, especially when the jack has ended up in the ditch too, cannot be over stated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It can be hard to get a toucher, and sometimes a bit risky, as you can never be sure where the jack will end up, so its best done with caution. </p>
