<p>In this blog post, I'll be comparing two of the most popular lawn bowls out there - the Taylor International and the Drakes Pride D-TEC. We'll be looking at the specs, bias, grip options, price, and who each bowl is best suited for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the end of this guide, you'll have all the knowledge you need to choose the perfect lawn bowl for you. So let's get started!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2706} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International is a mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl suitable for outdoor play. It is a versatile bowl and can be used on different surfaces and conditions. These bowls are available in sizes 00 to 5 and are exclusively sold in the UK market. While these bowls may be purchased new, they can also be found in online second hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC is a narrow-biased lawn bowl that is best suited for indoor playing surfaces. It is particularly well-suited for players who play lead or who play on fast outdoor greens. Available in sizes 00 to 5, this bowl can be difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay, but it can be purchased new. Overall, the Drakes Pride D-TEC is an excellent option for indoor bowlers looking for a high-quality, narrow-biased bowl.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of bias, the Taylor International and the Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowls have very different characteristics. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2824} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International is a midbiased/wide biased bowl, which makes it suitable for outdoor greens and all outdoor surfaces. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride D-TEC is a narrow biased bowl and is ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. This makes it suitable for indoor bowlers, but not as suitable for those who predominantly play outdoors in the UK.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the Taylor International is placed between the Ace and the Legacy in the Taylor range and can be considered as a good all-around choice. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, the D-TEC is the narrowest biased bowl in the Drakes Pride range, making it a specialized option. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2805} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two bowls will come down to the individual player's playing style and environment. Understanding the unique characteristics of each bowl will be important in making the best selection for your needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of grip, the Taylor International comes with a dimple grip called the Progrip as standard. However, it does not offer an embedded grip option. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride D-TEC only comes with a standard dimple grip, but this style of grip is a classic choice for bowlers as the finger tips sit in the divots along the shoulder of the bowl, providing a good grip. An embedded grip, which is deeper set into the bowl, makes the bowl feel smaller in your hand and can be beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the price of the Taylor International and the Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowls, it is clear that there is a significant difference in cost. The Taylor International is priced higher, both for new and second-hand options, with a new set costing £360 and a second-hand set ranging from £100 to £190.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride D-TEC is more budget-friendly, with a new set costing around £290 and a second-hand set ranging from £120 to £200. The lower price point of the D-TEC may make it a more attractive option for those who are new to the sport or on a tighter budget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while the Taylor International may have a higher price point, both lawn bowls are well-regarded options in the sport and ultimately the decision between the two may come down to personal preference, as well as budget considerations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to selecting lawn bowls, it's important to keep in mind the specific needs of the player. The Taylor International is a mid-biased bowl suited for outdoor play, making it a great option for those who enjoy playing outdoors. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride D-TEC is a narrow biased bowl that is primarily aimed at indoor bowlers but can also be played on faster outdoor surfaces. This makes it an excellent choice for lead bowlers who play predominantly indoor games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of playing style, the Taylor International would suit players who prefer a mid-biased bowl that can be played on a variety of surfaces. This makes it great for those who like to try out different playing conditions, including indoor and outdoor venues. The Drakes Pride D-TEC, on the other hand, is best for lead bowlers who play mainly indoor games but occasionally venture onto faster outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, both the Taylor International and the Drakes Pride D-TEC are excellent lawn bowls that cater to different playing styles and preferences. It's important for players to consider their specific needs when choosing between the two, whether they prefer playing indoors or outdoors, and which position they typically occupy in games. Either way, players can expect top-quality performance and excellent handling from their chosen lawn bowl.</p>
