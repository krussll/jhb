<p>In this blog post, I'll be comparing two of the most popular models - the Taylor Vector VS and the Taylor Blaze. I'll be taking a look at their specs, bias, grip options, price, and who they'll be best for. By the end of this guide, you'll have a better idea of which lawn bowl would suit you best. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a narrow biased lawn bowl suitable for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. Its size range only applies to the UK market but can be found second hand on online marketplaces like eBay. This model is best for indoor bowlers or those playing lead on outdoor greens with a quick surface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It is a versatile option that can be used on multiple surfaces and conditions. The Blaze is available in various sizes ranging from 00 to 5, but this model is only sold in the UK market. It can also be purchased through online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. Overall, the Taylor Blaze is an excellent choice for players who seek a bowl with reliable performance on different playing surfaces.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the Taylor Blaze and the Taylor Vector VS lawn bowls is their bias. The Blaze has a mid-bias, while the Vector VS has a narrow bias. This means that the Blaze will have a wider arc when it travels down the green, while the Vector VS will have a more direct path towards the target.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blaze is suitable for both indoor and outdoor greens, making it a versatile option for bowlers. However, the Vector VS is ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens, making it more specialized for specific conditions. Both bowls are suitable for indoor and outdoor bowlers, but the Vector VS may be better suited for experienced players who can adjust to its narrow bias. Ultimately, the choice between these two bowls will depend on personal preference and the specific conditions of the green.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze and the Taylor Vector VS are two popular models of lawn bowls with different grip options. The Taylor Vector VS comes with the Taylor Progrip, a well-known dimple grip. The Taylor Blaze comes with the Taylor Premier grip, which is similar to the Progrip but with oblong dimples.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both bowls do not offer an embedded grip option, but an embedded grip is beneficial for those who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. On the other hand, a dimple grip is a classic style of grip that provides a better grip by allowing your fingertips to sit in the dimples of the bowl's shoulder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Vector VS and the Taylor Blaze are great options for lawn bowls, with the Progrip and Premier grip providing good options for grip.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to pricing, the Taylor Vector VS and the Taylor Blaze are very similar. Both models can be purchased brand new for a price of £360. However, when looking at second hand options, there is a slight difference between the two. The Taylor Vector VS can be found for a lower price range of around £160-£190, while the Taylor Blaze tends to be sold for around £210-£230 in the second hand market.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the pricing of the two models may vary slightly, it is important to also consider the features and benefits of each lawn bowl in relation to their price. The Taylor Vector VS is known for its precision and performance on a variety of green conditions, while the Taylor Blaze is more suitable for faster surfaces. Ultimately, the choice between these two popular models will depend on the individual bowler's preference and playing style.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to choosing between the Taylor Blaze and the Taylor Vector VS, it all comes down to personal preference and the type of surfaces on which the player will be playing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is more suitable for indoor bowlers who play lead position. Its narrow bias allows for a more controlled and accurate delivery, which is important when playing indoors where the greens tend to be slower. However, it can also be used on faster outdoor surfaces. Players who enjoy playing lead position and have a preference for more controlled delivery will benefit from the Taylor Vector VS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Taylor Blaze is more versatile and can be used indoors or outdoors. Its mid-bias allows for a smoother delivery, which is ideal for players who tend to play a variety of positions. The Blaze is perfect for bowlers who may play on a variety of greens or who want to use the same set of bowls no matter where they are playing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, the decision between the Taylor Blaze and the Taylor Vector VS comes down to the player’s individual preferences and the surfaces on which they will be playing. If a player primarily plays indoor and is a lead bowler, the Taylor Vector VS may suit them best. However, for those who play a variety of positions and on a variety of surfaces, the Taylor Blaze is a more versatile and suitable option.</p>
