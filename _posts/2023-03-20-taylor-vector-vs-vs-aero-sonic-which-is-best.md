<p>Today, we'll be looking at two popular models of lawn bowls - the Taylor Vector VS and the Aero Sonic. I'll be taking a look at the specs, the bias, the grip options, the price, and who these bowls are best suited for. By the time we're done, you'll have a much better idea of which lawn bowl is the perfect fit for you!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS lawn bowl is a narrow bias model that is designed for both indoor play as well as fast outdoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. This bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. It can be purchased new or secondhand on online marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Sonic lawn bowl is a wide biased model that is designed for outdoor play. It is suitable for use on all outdoor surfaces and is particularly well-suited for skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, the Aero Sonic is not commonly found on second hand marketplaces like eBay. As a result, interested buyers may need to purchase this model new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the Aero Sonic lawn bowl and the Taylor Vector VS lawn bowl, it's important to note their different biases. The Vector VS is a narrow biased bowl, ideal for both indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. It is suitable for indoor bowlers and lead outdoor bowlers. On the other hand, the Sonic is a mid-biased/wide biased bowl, making it the widest bowl in the Aero range. It is specifically designed for outdoor greens and is suitable for all outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, it's clear that the Vector VS is designed to provide more precision and accuracy on the green with its narrow bias, while the Sonic is better suited for outdoor play with its mid/wide bias. The choice between the two bowls ultimately depends on the player's individual needs and preferences. Those competing in indoor rinks or looking for a more precise shot may benefit from the Vector VS, while those playing on outdoor greens may find the Sonic to be a better fit for their game.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Sonic offers a wider range of grip options compared to the Taylor Vector VS, including the dimple, embedded, and non-gripped options. Moreover, these grips come as standard and do not have any additional cost. In contrast, the Taylor Vector VS only comes with the Taylor Progrip, which is a dimple grip and is considered one of the best in the market. However, it does not offer an embedded grip option, which can be beneficial for bowlers who struggle with grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, which can make the bowl feel smaller in your hand. This can be advantageous for bowlers who have problems gripping the bowl properly. On the other hand, the dimple grip is a classic style of grip that features small divots along the shoulder of the bowl. When your fingertips sit in these dimples, it provides you with a better grip. Keep these grip options in mind when considering the Taylor Vector VS versus the Aero Sonic lawn bowls.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the price of the Taylor Vector VS and the Aero Sonic lawn bowls, it is clear that the Aero Sonic is slightly more expensive. A new set of Aero Sonic's can be bought for around £400, while a new set of Taylor Vector VS bowls will cost around £360. However, it is worth noting that if you are looking to buy a second-hand set of lawn bowls, the price difference between the two models becomes less significant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are in the market for second-hand lawn bowls, you can expect to pay around £160-£190 for a set of Taylor Vector VS bowls, while a set of second-hand Aero Sonic bowls is likely to cost you around £300-£360. Ultimately, the price difference between these two models will depend on whether you are buying new or second-hand, and how much you are willing to pay for your lawn bowls. Both the Taylor Vector VS and the Aero Sonic are popular models of lawn bowls, and both offer high quality and excellent performance on the green.</p>
