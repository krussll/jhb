<p>In this blog post, I will be comparing two of the most popular lawn bowls – the Taylor Lignoid and the Henselite Tiger Pro. I will be taking a closer look at the spec, bias, grip options, price, and ultimately, who each bowl is best suited for. By the end of this guide, you will feel confident in your decision and know which bowl is the perfect fit for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid is a great option for outdoor play on all surfaces, with a wide bias ideal for skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, the Taylor Lignoid can be found online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro is a mid-biased lawn bowl ideal for both indoor and outdoor play. It is recommended for bowlers who play on various surfaces and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only. As one of the more expensive bowls on the market, it is not commonly found on online second-hand marketplaces, making it likely you will need to purchase it new.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference in bias between the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Taylor Lignoid lawn bowls is their width. The Lignoid is a wide biased bowl, whereas the Tiger Pro is a mid-biased bowl. This means the Lignoid has a greater arc and turn than the Tiger Pro when bowled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the Lignoid is specifically designed for outdoor greens, while the Tiger Pro is suitable for both indoor rinks and all outdoor greens. The Lignoid should be avoided for indoor play, while the Tiger Pro is ideal for those who bowl all year round both indoors and outdoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both lawn bowls have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice ultimately depends on the player's preference and the conditions they will be bowling in.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lignoid and Henselite Tiger Pro are popular models of lawn bowls. The Taylor Lignoid comes with a dimple grip called the Progrip, while the Henselite Tiger Pro comes with an embedded grip called the Henselite Mega grip. An embedded grip is deeper set into the bowl and can be helpful for bowlers with grip issues. Conversely, a dimple grip is a classic style that uses small divots for finger placement. While the Taylor Progrip is considered one of the best dimple grips available, an embedded grip is generally preferred. The Taylor Lignoid does not offer an embedded grip option, making the Henselite Tiger Pro a better choice for bowlers who prioritize grip.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to lawn bowls, both the Taylor Lignoid and the Henselite Tiger Pro are popular choices among players. However, there is a significant difference between the prices of these two models. The Taylor Lignoid is more affordable, with a new set costing around £290 and second-hand sets around £90-£130. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger Pro is considerably more expensive, with new sets costing around £400 and second-hand sets around £250-£300.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Taylor Lignoid is a more budget-friendly option, it's important to note that the price difference between the two models may reflect differences in quality and performance. The Henselite Tiger Pro is known for its superior grip and consistency, which may be worth the extra investment for serious lawn bowlers. Ultimately, the choice between these two models will depend on personal preference, playing style, and budget.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lignoid and Henselite Tiger Pro are popular models of lawn bowls. The Taylor Lignoid is a wide biased bowl that is specifically designed for outdoor play. If you primarily play outdoors, then the Taylor Lignoid would be a good choice for you. However, if you play both indoors and outdoors, the Henselite Tiger Pro is the better option. The Tiger Pro is a dual purpose bowl that offers the flexibility to play in multiple positions in a team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, the Henselite Tiger Pro offers players the added advantage of being able to play indoors. This makes it an excellent choice for players who want to use the same bowl for both types of play. On the other hand, the Taylor Lignoid should be avoided if you frequently play indoors, as its wide bias may not be as effective in indoor conditions. Ultimately, the choice between these two models depends on your playing habits and preferences.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Lignoid and the Henselite Tiger Pro are top-performing lawn bowls. The Taylor Lignoid is best suited for outdoor play and is ideal for skips, while the Henselite Tiger Pro is a versatile bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. However, the Henselite Tiger Pro comes at a premium price and is difficult to find on the second-hand market. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the bowler.</p>
