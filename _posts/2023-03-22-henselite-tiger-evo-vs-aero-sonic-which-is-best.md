<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2723} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl that provides versatility on various surfaces and conditions. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and is commonly purchased new due to its limited availability on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2735} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Sonic is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. Its versatility makes it ideal for all outdoor surfaces, and it is well-suited to skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, the Aero Sonic can be challenging to find secondhand on online marketplaces such as eBay. It is recommended to purchase this bowl new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Aero Sonic and the Henselite Tiger EVO are mid-biased or wide biased lawn bowls designed for outdoor greens and suitable for all outdoor surfaces. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2838} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Henselite Tiger EVO falls between the Tiger Pro and Tiger in the Henselite range, whereas the Aero Sonic is the widest bowl in the Aero range. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO has a reputation for being a dependable option for outdoor greens, while the Aero Sonic is known for its wider line and an enhanced bias for a consistent draw and holding line. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2833} /-->

<p>Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on individual preferences and playing styles.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grip options, the Aero Sonic lawn bowl outshines the Henselite Tiger EVO. Aero offers a wider range of grip options including dimple, embedded, and non-gripped options - all of which are available on their whole range of bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparison, the Henselite Tiger EVO comes with the Henselite Mega grip as standard, which is an embedded grip. While embedded grips are great for bowlers who have trouble gripping the bowl properly, they may feel smaller in your hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, if grip options are important to you, the Aero Sonic is the clear winner. However, if you prefer an embedded grip, the Henselite Tiger EVO may suit you better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger EVO and Aero Sonic are premium models of lawn bowls that come with a hefty price tag. While the cost of a brand new set of either bowls is around £400, you may be able to find a second-hand set for a slightly lower price.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the two models, there isn't much of a difference. The Henselite Tiger EVO can be found for around £250-£300 second-hand, whereas the Aero Sonic is usually priced at around £300-£360 when buying used. Overall, both bowls are similarly priced, and it ultimately comes down to personal preference and which model suits your playing style better.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to choosing between the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Aero Sonic lawn bowls, it's important to consider the specific needs of the player. The Henselite Tiger EVO is suited for those who play both indoors and outdoors, while the Aero Sonic is more focused on outdoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mid-biased nature of the Tiger EVO makes it an ideal choice for players who want more versatility in their game. It can be played on different surfaces for various bowling styles. The Aero Sonic, on the other hand, is an exceptional outdoor bowl that thrives in outdoor settings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Finally, the Aero Sonic's flexibility in various positions makes it great for team play.
