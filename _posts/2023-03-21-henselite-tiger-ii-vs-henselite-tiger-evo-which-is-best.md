<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-to-wide bias bowl that is suitable for outdoor play. It is a versatile bowl that can be used on various surfaces and conditions. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only and is not commonly found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. If you are interested in purchasing the Henselite Tiger EVO, you will most likely need to buy it new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the Henselite Tiger EVO and the Henselite Tiger II lawn bowls lies in their bias. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2831} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow biased bowl, making it ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. It is also suitable for indoor bowlers and lead outdoor bowlers. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-biased or wide biased bowl, making it more suitable for outdoor greens and all outdoor surfaces. Its bias is between the Tiger Pro and the Tiger in the Henselite range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, the Henselite Tiger II is a bowl with a narrow bias, ideal for indoor and fast outdoor greens, while the Henselite Tiger EVO is a bowl with a midbiased or wide biased, which is more suitable for outdoor greens and all outdoor surfaces. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The choice between the two depends on the specific playing conditions and the player's personal preference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the grips of Henselite Tiger EVO and Henselite Tiger II lawn bowls, both models come with the Henselite Mega grip as standard. This grip style is an embedded grip, set deeper into the bowl to make it feel smaller in your hand. This is particularly beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the grip style is the same between the two models, it's worth noting that the Henselite Tiger II also offers the option of a dimple grip style. This classic grip style features small divots or dimples along the bowl's shoulder, designed to help secure your fingertips and provide a better grip. The absence of this option in the Henselite Tiger EVO is a consideration for bowlers who prefer the classic dimple style grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Henselite Tiger II and Henselite Tiger EVO offer the Henselite Mega grip as standard - an embedded grip useful for those with grip issues. However, the Henselite Tiger II also offers the classic dimple grip style option, whereas the Henselite Tiger EVO does not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Henselite Tiger II and the Henselite Tiger EVO are fairly comparable. The Tiger II can be purchased brand new for around £420, while a second-hand set can be found for around £200-£290. Meanwhile, the Tiger EVO costs around £400 brand new and a second-hand set can be found for around £250-£300.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it's worth noting that the Tiger EVO is a newer model and has some updated features that may make it worth the slight price bump for some bowlers. For example, the EVO has a wider drawing arc, making it easier to control on the green, and a slightly modified profile that some bowlers find more comfortable to hold. Ultimately, the choice between these two popular Henselite models will depend on individual bowlers' preferences and priorities.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to choosing between the Henselite Tiger II and the Henselite Tiger EVO, it really comes down to personal preference and the type of surface you will be playing on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II is ideal for those who primarily play indoor bowls and for those who play lead often. Its narrow bias allows for precision and accuracy, making it easier to draw to the jack. However, the narrow bias may not be ideal for outdoor play on slower surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger EVO is great for outdoor play on a variety of surfaces. Its mid-bias allows for a wider range of shots, making it easier to adjust to different situations on the green. The Henselite Tiger EVO may not be as precise as the Tiger II, but it offers versatility for outdoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, both bowls have their strengths and weaknesses. If you primarily play indoor bowls or lead often, the Henselite Tiger II may be the best option for you. If you play mostly outdoor bowls or want a bowl that can adapt to different surfaces, the Henselite Tiger EVO may be the better choice.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Henselite Tiger II and the Henselite Tiger EVO are high-quality lawn bowls that cater to different playing styles and conditions. The Tiger II is best suited for indoor play and fast outdoor greens, while the Tiger EVO is more versatile and can be used on various surfaces and weather conditions. Both models are available in similar sizes and can be difficult to find second-hand, often making it necessary to purchase them new. Ultimately, the choice between these two models will depend on individual preferences and playing style.</p>
