We'll be comparing everything from spec to grip options to price, and by the end of this guide, I'll make sure you have a clear idea of which of these bowls would be the perfect fit for you.

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a narrow biased lawn bowl designed for fast indoor and outdoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or lead players on fast outdoor greens. The bowl is only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<p>The Aero Quantum is a narrow biased lawn bowl that is perfect for indoor play and quick outdoor greens. This bowl is a great option for indoor bowlers or lead players who prefer a fast-paced game. It is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. While it may be difficult to find the Aero Quantum on online second-hand marketplaces, purchasing new is an option.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Aero Quantum and Taylor Vector VS lawn bowls are narrow biased bowls that are ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. While the Vector VS is suited for lead outdoor bowlers and is in-between the Lazer and Blaze models from Taylor, the Quantum is the narrowest bowl in the Aero range and is suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both lawn bowl models have their own unique strengths and are suitable for different skill levels and playing environments. Players should consider the particular features of each model when selecting their preferred lawn bowl.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS comes with the Taylor Progrip as standard, which is a quality dimple grip. However, it does not have the option for an embedded grip. In contrast, the Aero Quantum offers a range of grip options at no extra cost, including a dimple, embedded, and non-gripped option. This makes Aero an excellent choice for bowlers who need a specific type of grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip is good for bowlers struggling with grip, as it is set deeper into the bowl and makes it feel smaller in your hand. On the other hand, a dimple grip is a classic style where small divots run along the shoulder of the bowl. This is ideal for bowlers who want a simple, traditional grip. Overall, the Aero Quantum offers more flexibility and convenience when it comes to grip options, making it a great choice for both beginner and veteran bowlers.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, both the Taylor Vector VS and the Aero Quantum are in the same ballpark. The Taylor Vector VS comes in at about £360 when bought new, while the Aero Quantum is just slightly more expensive at around £400 for a fresh set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're looking to save a bit of money, the Taylor Vector VS is a good bet as you can pick up a second-hand set for around £160-£190. The Aero Quantum is a bit pricier when it comes to buying used as it can cost around £300-£360.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Vector VS and the Aero Quantum are high-end options for lawn bowls, so it ultimately comes down to personal preference and your budget. However, if you're on a tight budget and still want a high-quality bowl, the Taylor Vector VS might be the way to go, while the Aero Quantum is an excellent choice for those with a bit more to spend.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Vector VS and the Aero Quantum are narrow biased bowls that offer precision and accuracy. However, they have different target audiences. The Taylor Vector VS is ideal for indoor bowling and is best suited for lead bowlers. On the other hand, the Aero Quantum is a more versatile option that can be used both indoors and outdoors. It can cater to various positions in a team indoors, and its narrow bias makes it a suitable choice for lead bowlers when used outdoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're an indoor bowler who often finds himself playing the lead role, the Taylor Vector VS is the right choice for you. Its narrow bias allows for easy handling on indoor surfaces, and its design makes it perfect for leads. However, if you're looking for a bowl that can offer you versatility and can be used both indoors and outdoors, the Aero Quantum is a better option. Its narrow bias allows for precision and accuracy, making it suitable for various positions in a team indoors and for lead bowlers when utilized outdoors.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Vector VS and the Aero Quantum are excellent options for indoor and fast outdoor bowling. They both have a narrow bias and are suitable for lead bowlers. However, the Aero Quantum may be a better option for those who prefer to buy new bowls, as they are harder to find on second-hand marketplaces like eBay. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on personal preference and availability in your area.</p>
