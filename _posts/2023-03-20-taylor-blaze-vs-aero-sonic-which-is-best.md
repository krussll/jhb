<p>That's why I am here to help you compare two of the most popular models - the Taylor Blaze and the Aero Sonic. Throughout this guide, I will be breaking down the spec, bias, grip options, price, and who each bowl is best suited for. After reading this guide, you will have the confidence to make an informed decision and choose the bowl that's right for you.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze is a mid-biased lawn bowl, suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. Its versatility makes it suitable for various playing surfaces and conditions. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. Additionally, the Taylor Blaze can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Sonic model of lawn bowls is a wide biased option that is great for outdoor play, especially on all outdoor surfaces. It is especially well-suited to skips. This model is available in sizes 00 to 5, but is only available for purchase in the UK market. It can be difficult to find second-hand options online, so buyers may need to purchase this bowl new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Aero Sonic and Taylor Blaze lawn bowls have mid-bias characteristics, although the Sonic has a wider bias than the Blaze. The Blaze is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play, while the Sonic is recommended for outdoor green surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blaze is said to be suitable for bowlers of all levels, while the Sonic's wider bias may make it more suitable for experienced players who can make the most of its potential. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the individual player's preferences and the playing conditions they most frequently encounter.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Sonic lawn bowl offers more grip options than the Taylor Blaze, including a dimple, embedded grip, and non-gripped option. All grips come as standard and cost nothing extra, and they are available on their whole range of lawn bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the Taylor Blaze comes with the Taylor Premier grip as standard, which is similar to the Taylor Progrip but has oblong dimples instead of circular ones. The Blaze does not offer an embedded grip option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl may prefer an embedded grip as it is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in their hand. Alternatively, a classic dimple grip may suit those who prefer their fingertips to sit in the small divots along the bowl's shoulder for a better grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Aero Sonic lawn bowls are noticeably more expensive than the Taylor Blaze. A set of brand-new Aero Sonic bowls can cost around £400, compared to the Taylor Blaze which is priced at £360. Even when purchasing second-hand, the Aero Sonic still commands a higher price range of approximately £300 to £360, while the older Taylor Blaze models cost around £210 to £230.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the difference in price, both the Aero Sonic and Taylor Blaze are highly-regarded lawn bowls. The Aero Sonic is known for its superior accuracy and stability, while the Taylor Blaze features a sleek design with a comfortable grip. Ultimately, the choice between the two may come down to personal preference and budget. With the Aero Sonic at the higher end of the price range, it may be a more attractive option for serious competitors, while the Taylor Blaze may be more suited to those looking for a reliable and affordable option.</p>
