<p>In this blog post, I'll be comparing two top-rated models - the Taylor Lignoid and the Henselite Tiger II. Throughout this guide, we'll dive into the specs, bias, grip options, price, and which bowls are best suited for certain players. By the end of this post, you'll have a clear understanding of which lawn bowl is the perfect fit for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid is a wide biased lawn bowl that is well-suited for outdoor play on all types of surfaces. It is particularly ideal for skips and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only. This model can also be found on second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow-bias lawn bowl suitable for fast outdoor and indoor play, especially for lead bowlers. It comes in UK sizes 00 to 5 but can be difficult to find in online second-hand marketplaces, making it more suitable for those who prefer purchasing brand new sets.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid and Henselite Tiger II lawn bowls have different biases, making them suitable for different playing conditions. The Lignoid has a wider bias and is ideal for outdoor greens, while the Tiger II has a narrower bias and is better suited for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. The Lignoid is one of the widest bowls in the Taylor range and the Legacy SL is its counterpart for all outdoor surfaces. On the other hand, the Tiger II is positioned between the Tiger TX and Tiger Pro in the Henselite range, with its focus on indoor bowlers and lead outdoor bowlers. When selecting a bowl, it's important to consider your playing conditions and personal preferences in order to achieve the best results on the greens.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of the Henselite Tiger II and the Taylor Lignoid lawn bowls, it's important to note the difference between the two. The Taylor Lignoid comes with the Progrip, a classic dimple grip that provides a secure hold. However, the Lignoid doesn't offer an embedded grip like the Henselite Tiger II.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II does come with an embedded grip, which is set deeper into the bowl for a smaller feel. This is beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. While the embedded grip can be advantageous for some users, it's important to note that it is a matter of personal preference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, the choice between the two grips depends on the user's individual needs and preferences. While the Taylor Lignoid has a classic dimple grip, the Henselite Tiger II provides an embedded grip that can be beneficial for certain users. Ultimately, the best choice between these two models comes down to the user's comfort level and ability to grip the bowl with ease.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Taylor Lignoid and the Henselite Tiger II lawn bowls, it is clear that the Taylor Lignoid is the more affordable option. The Taylor Lignoid can be purchased new for £290, which is significantly lower than the £420 price tag of a new Henselite Tiger II. Additionally, those on a tight budget might find the £90-130 price range for a second-hand Taylor Lignoid even more appealing, as it is less than half the cost of a second-hand Henselite Tiger II at £200-290.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That being said, it is important to consider the quality of the lawn bowls when making a purchasing decision, as cost is not always indicative of performance. While the Taylor Lignoid may be the more budget-friendly option, the Henselite Tiger II may offer superior performance, making it worth the higher price tag for serious lawn bowl players. Ultimately, the decision will depend on the player's skill level, playing style, and personal preferences, as well as their budget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are a lawn bowls player who exclusively plays outdoors, the Taylor Lignoid may be the perfect bowl for you with its wide bias. However, if you are someone who mainly plays indoors, the Henselite Tiger II's narrow bias is better suited for the tighter curves of indoor rinks. Additionally, if you frequently play as the lead position, the Henselite Tiger II may be more beneficial for its accuracy and control. Ultimately, the decision between these two models will come down to personal preference and the type of game you typically play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After comparing the Taylor Lignoid and the Henselite Tiger II, it's clear that both lawn bowls have their own unique strengths and ideal playing conditions. The Taylor Lignoid is wider and ideal for outdoor play, while the Henselite Tiger II is narrow and better suited for indoor play or fast outdoor greens. Both bowls are available in the same sizes for the UK market, but finding a secondhand set of Henselite Tiger II bowls can be difficult. Ultimately, the choice between these two popular models will depend on individual player preferences and the type of playing conditions they frequently encounter.</p>
