<p>We'll be covering everything from technical specs and bias to grip options and price, so you can make an informed decision about which bowl is the right fit for you. By the time you're finished reading, you'll have a much better idea of which model will help you knock your opponents' socks off!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International is a versatile lawn bowl with a mid-to-wide bias, suitable for outdoor play on various surfaces and conditions. This bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only and can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow biased lawn bowl designed for indoor and fast outdoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or those who typically lead on fast outdoor greens. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, the Henselite Tiger II can be difficult to find on online second hand marketplaces such as eBay, making it necessary to purchase a set brand new.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of bias, the Henselite Tiger II lawn bowl and the Taylor International lawn bowl differ greatly. The Tiger II has a narrow bias, making it more suitable for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens, and is recommended for indoor and lead outdoor bowlers. On the other hand, the International has a midbiased or wide bias, making it ideal for outdoor greens and suitable for all outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Tiger II is part of the Henselite range between the Tiger TX and the Tiger Pro, the International is between the Ace and the Legacy in the Taylor range. It is important to note that the bias of a lawn bowl can greatly affect the game play and performance of a bowler. Therefore, understanding the differences in bias between two lawn bowls is important when selecting the right bowl for a specific surface and desired play style.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of grips, the Henselite Tiger II has the advantage with its embedded Mega grip. This grip is set deeper into the bowl which can help bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. On the other hand, the Taylor International has a dimple grip called the Progrip, which is considered one of the best dimple grips around. However, an embedded grip is overall better than a dimple grip, as it allows for a more secure grip and reduces the chances of the bowl slipping out of one's hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the two models will depend on personal preference and individual needs. Bowlers who require a larger grip might prefer the Henselite Tiger II, while those who prefer a classic style of grip might go for the Taylor International. It is important for bowlers to test out both models to see which one suits them better and provides the most comfortable and secure grip.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Taylor International and Henselite Tiger II lawn bowls differ slightly. The Taylor International is a more budget-friendly option, with new bowls costing around £360 and second-hand ones ranging from £100-£190. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger II is a more premium option, with new bowls usually priced around £420 and second-hand ones ranging from £200-£290.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it's important to remember that price shouldn't be the only consideration when choosing lawn bowls. The quality of the bowls, the weight, and the grip all play a factor in your overall performance. It's worth trying out both the Taylor International and Henselite Tiger II to see which one feels more comfortable and suits your gameplay style the most, rather than just going for the cheaper or more expensive option based on price alone.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International bowl is best suited for those who play outdoors and want a mid-biased bowl that can be played on all surfaces. It is a great option for those who play both singles and team games. The Taylor International is also an excellent choice for bowlers who prefer a more traditional bowl design.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger II is a narrow biased bowl ideal for indoor bowlers. It can also be played on faster outdoor surfaces, but its narrower bias makes it best suited for those playing on indoor rinks. Bowlers who play lead a lot will also appreciate the precision and accuracy of the Henselite Tiger II.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, the Taylor International and the Henselite Tiger II are both excellent bowls, but they are best suited for different types of bowlers. The Taylor International is for those who play more outdoors and want a mid-biased bowl, while the Henselite Tiger II is perfect for indoor bowlers and lead players who want a narrow bias.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, choosing between the Taylor International and the Henselite Tiger II lawn bowls ultimately comes down to personal preference and playing style. The Taylor International is a mid-to-wide biased bowl that is versatile enough to be used on a variety of surfaces and available on online second-hand marketplaces. In contrast, the Henselite Tiger II is a narrow biased bowl best suited for indoor play and fast outdoor greens, but may be more difficult to find secondhand. Both models are available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, so it's important to try out both before making a decision. Ultimately, both lawn bowls are reliable and popular choices among bowlers.</p>
