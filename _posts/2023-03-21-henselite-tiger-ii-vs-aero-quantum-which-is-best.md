<p>The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow-biased lawn bowl designed for indoor and fast outdoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, the Henselite Tiger II can be tricky to find on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.

<p>The Aero Quantum is a narrow-biased lawn bowl that is perfect for fast outdoor and indoor play. It is well-suited for bowlers who play lead on fast outdoor greens or regularly play indoors. The sizes available in the UK market range from 00 to 5. However, they are challenging to find on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay, and it is advisable to purchase them new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II and Aero Quantum lawn bowls are both narrow biased and suitable for indoor and outdoor use. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2831} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Tiger II is specifically designed for faster greens, the Quantum is suitable for all types of greens. The Tiger II is also positioned between the Tiger TX and Tiger Pro in the Henselite range, while the Quantum is the narrowest bowl in the Aero range. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both bowls offer similar bias and versatility, but the Tiger II may be better for experienced bowlers on fast greens, while the Quantum may be great for indoor and outdoor use regardless of the bowling experience.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II has an embedded grip called the Henselite Mega grip, while the Aero Quantum offers a range of grip options including an embedded grip, dimple grip, and a non-gripped option. The embedded grip on the Henselite Tiger II is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the hand and ideal for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl. The dimple grip on the Aero Quantum features small divots in the shoulder of the bowl, allowing for better grip with the fingertips. Aero offers all grip options at no additional cost, and they are available on their entire range of lawn bowls, including the Aero GrooVe and Aero Sonic.</p>
