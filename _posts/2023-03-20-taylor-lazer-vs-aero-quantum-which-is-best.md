<p>By the end of this guide, I'll have analyzed the spec of the bowls, the bias, the grip options, the price, and who each bowl is best for. You'll be equipped with the knowledge to make an informed decision and choose the perfect lawn bowl for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer is a lawn bowl model with a narrow bias that is designed for indoor play. It is an excellent choice for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. The sizes available for the UK market range from 00 to 5, with second-hand options often found on online marketplaces such as eBay. Its unique design makes it a desirable choice for those who prioritize precision and control in their game.</p>

<p>The Aero Quantum is a narrow biased lawn bowl model designed for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. It is most suitable for indoor bowlers or for those playing the lead position in outdoor games. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, the Aero Quantum is a quality option that may be difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces. New purchases are recommended for those seeking this model.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lazer and the Aero Quantum lawn bowls are narrow biased, making them suitable for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. However, the Lazer is only recommended for indoor bowlers and fast green outdoor play, while the Quantum is suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowling. The Lazer is the narrowest biased bowl in the Taylor range, while the Quantum is the narrowest bowl in the Aero range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both bowls share similarities in their narrow bias and ideal use for indoor rinks and fast greens, their differences lie in their suitability for outdoor play and level of bias. The Aero Quantum caters to a broader range of bowlers, making it a more versatile option. On the other hand, the Taylor Lazer may be more effective for specific indoor and fast green outdoor play circumstances. Ultimately, bowlers must consider their playing environment and preferences to select the best suited lawn bowl for their game.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum lawn bowl offers a wider range of grip options compared to the Taylor Lazer. The Aero Quantum has the option of a dimple, embedded, and non-gripped grip, all of which come as standard and cost nothing extra. Meanwhile, the Taylor Lazer only offers a Progrip which is a dimple grip and is considered to be one of the best around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, unlike the Taylor Lazer, the embedded grip of the Aero Quantum is set deeper in the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand. This is a good option for bowlers who have trouble gripping the bowl properly. On the other hand, the dimple grip of the Taylor Lazer is a classic style of grip where small divots or dimples run along the shoulder of the bowl, providing better grip for the finger tips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Aero Quantum offers more grip options while the Taylor Lazer only offers a high-quality dimple grip. Bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl may benefit from the deeper, embedded grip of the Aero Quantum. Those who prefer a classic style of grip may prefer the dimple grip of the Taylor Lazer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Taylor Lazer seems to be more affordable than the Aero Quantum. A new set of Taylor Lazers can be bought for £290, while the Aero Quantum can cost around £400. Even second hand, the Taylor Lazer still comes out on top with a price range of £150-£170 compared to the Aero Quantum's range of £300-£360.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it's important to keep in mind that the price difference can be attributed to variations in design, materials used, and performance capabilities. The Aero Quantum, for instance, is known for its innovative Aero Dynamic technology and unique grip features that provide enhanced precision and control. On the other hand, the Taylor Lazer is praised for its durability and versatility. Ultimately, the price of these lawn bowls should be considered in conjunction with the specific features and benefits they offer to ensure the best value for your money.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Lazer and the Aero Quantum are narrow biased bowls that are designed to cater to the needs of indoor bowlers. However, while the Taylor Lazer is more suited for lead bowlers, the Aero Quantum is a more versatile option that can be used in a variety of positions within a team, both indoors and outdoors. So, if you primarily play indoors and you're a lead bowler, the Taylor Lazer might be the better option for you. On the other hand, if you want a bowl that can work well both indoors and outdoors and can be used in a range of positions, the Aero Quantum would be a better choice. Ultimately, the decision will come down to your individual needs and preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Lazer and the Aero Quantum are great options for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. However, while the Taylor Lazer is only ideal for indoor play, the Aero Quantum can also be used on outdoor greens. Additionally, the Aero Quantum may be harder to find second-hand, but it is worth investing in new due to its versatility. Ultimately, the decision to choose between the two will depend on individual preferences and requirements.</p>
