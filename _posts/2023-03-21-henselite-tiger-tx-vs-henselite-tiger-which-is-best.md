<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2732} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX lawn bowl is a narrow biased model designed for indoor play. It is recommended for those who play lead on fast outdoor greens and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. While it may be hard to find on second-hand online marketplaces, new sets are readily available for purchase.</p>

<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide biased lawn bowl suitable for outdoor play on all surfaces. It is particularly well-suited for skip players and comes in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market. While it may be difficult to find secondhand online, new models are readily available.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger and the Henselite Tiger TX lawn bowls are two different bowl options that cater to different playing environments. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2835} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference in bias can be seen in their width, with the Tiger TX being narrow biased, while the Tiger is wide biased.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger TX is best suited for indoor rinks, making it an ideal option for indoor bowlers. On the other hand, the Tiger bowl has a wider bias and is best suited for outdoor greens, making it a suitable option for outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2828} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's essential to choose the right bowl that fits your desired playing environment to optimize your game. Therefore, players must understand the bias differences when selecting between these two Henselite lawn bowls.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger and the Henselite Tiger TX feature the same embedded grip known as the Henselite Mega grip. This type of grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand. This is beneficial for bowlers who have difficulty holding the bowl firmly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One notable difference between the two models, however, is that the Henselite Tiger TX is exclusively available with the Henselite Mega grip, while the Henselite Tiger offers an alternative dimple grip. The dimple grip is a classic style of grip, whereby small divots are found on the shoulder of the bowl. This design is intended to provide bowlers with a better grip by allowing their fingertips to sit comfortably within the divots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both models are designed to give bowlers a firm grip on the bowl, but the preference for a more traditional dimple grip versus the Henselite Mega grip will depend on individual bowlers and their specific needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When looking at the prices of the Henselite Tiger and the Henselite Tiger TX, there are some notable differences. The Tiger TX is generally more expensive, with a new set costing around £420 compared to the £400 price tag of the Tiger. However, if you're willing to buy second hand, the prices can vary widely, with the Tiger II ranging from £200-690 and the Tiger TX from £260-310.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the price differences, both the Henselite Tiger and the Tiger TX are popular choices for lawn bowlers. They both offer excellent grip, control, and stability on the green. The main difference between the two models is that the Tiger TX features a higher density material, making it slightly more durable and resistant to wear and tear. Ultimately, the decision between the two comes down to personal preference and budget. If you're looking for a slightly more affordable option, the Tiger might be the way to go. However, if you're willing to spend a bit more for increased durability, the Tiger TX could be a smart investment.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are an indoor bowler who primarily plays lead, the Henselite Tiger TX would be the ideal choice for you. Its narrow bias makes it perfect for indoor surfaces, allowing you to easily maneuver around obstacles and get close to the jack. However, if you primarily play outdoors, the Henselite Tiger would be a better option with its wide bias that makes it suitable for outdoor conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to note that both models have their own unique features that make them suited for specific situations. While the Henselite Tiger TX is best suited for indoor play and lead bowlers, the Henselite Tiger is designed for outdoor play and is not recommended for indoor use. It's important to consider your own playing style and environment before deciding on which model to invest in.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Henselite Tiger and Henselite Tiger TX are two popular models of lawn bowls that are designed for specific playing conditions. The Tiger TX is best suited for indoor play on fast greens, while the Tiger is ideal for outdoor play on any type of surface. Both of these bowls are only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, and while they may be hard to find on online second-hand marketplaces, they are readily available for purchase new. Ultimately, the choice between these two models will depend on your playing style and the conditions you play in.</p>
