<p>In this blog post, I'll be comparing two popular models of lawn bowls - the Henselite Tiger and the Aero Sonic. Throughout this guide, we'll discuss the technical details such as the spec of the bowls, the bias, grip options, and price. By the end of this post, you'll have a clearer understanding of which bowling option is perfect for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2719} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide biased bowl designed for outdoor play, ideal for all outdoor surfaces and suitable for skips. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market only. While it may be hard to find on online second-hand marketplaces, buying them new is the most realistic option.</p>

<p>The Aero Sonic lawn bowl is a wide biased bowl designed for outdoor play. It is suitable for all types of outdoor surfaces and is particularly suited for skips. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only in the UK market. Unfortunately, the Aero Sonic is not easy to find on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay, so purchasing them new may be the best option.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Aero Sonic and Henselite Tiger lawn bowls have a wide bias, making them suitable for outdoor greens. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2828} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger is known for its width and is ideal for outdoor surfaces, whereas the Aero Sonic is mid to wide biased and suitable for all types of outdoor surfaces. However, the Henselite Tiger should be avoided if you play predominantly indoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both lawn bowls have a bias towards the wider side, the Henselite Tiger is the widest in the Henselite range, while the Aero Sonic is the widest in the Aero range. Therefore, it ultimately comes down to personal preference and playing style when choosing between the two. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2833} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you play predominantly outdoors, both bowls would be suitable, but if you play indoors more often, the Aero Sonic may be the better choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger model features an embedded grip known as the Henselite Mega grip. This gives the bowl a smaller feel in the hand, making it ideal for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl. On the other hand, the Aero Sonic model offers a range of grip options, including an embedded grip, a dimple grip, and even a non-gripped option. Unlike other brands, all of Aero's grips are available on their entire range of bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The benefit of a dimple grip is that it offers classic style and design, with small divots or dimples running along the bowl's shoulder. This allows for more grip, as the fingertips can sit in the dimples to better hold the bowl. Overall, the Aero Sonic offers more grip options than the Henselite Tiger, making it a suitable choice for bowlers who want more control over their grip.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the price of the Henselite Tiger and the Aero Sonic, it is clear that both models are roughly equivalent, with each bowl costing around £400 when bought new. However, it is possible to shave some money off the cost of either bowl by purchasing second-hand. The Henselite Tiger II, for example, can be bought for between £200-690, while a second-hand set of Aero Sonic bowls typically costs between £300-£360. In sum, when it comes to price, both models fall within the same range and offer similar cost savings when bought second-hand.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger and the Aero Sonic are popular models of lawn bowls. However, they have different features that make them better suited for different players. The Henselite Tiger is designed for outdoor play and has a wide bias that makes it ideal for players who prefer to play outdoors exclusively. On the other hand, the Aero Sonic is an outdoor bowl that can also be used indoors. Its versatility makes it the best choice for players who want to be able to switch between indoor and outdoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, the Aero Sonic offers greater flexibility than the Henselite Tiger. It can be played in a range of positions within a team, making it the perfect choice for players who want to be able to adapt to different roles within a team. However, the Henselite Tiger can be an excellent choice for players who prefer a bowl with a wider bias, as it can provide better control over the trajectory of the bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, the choice between the Henselite Tiger and the Aero Sonic depends on individual preferences and playing styles. Those who play exclusively outdoors and want more control over their bowl’s trajectory may prefer the Henselite Tiger, while those who want to be able to play both indoors and outdoors and need greater versatility in their bowl can opt for the Aero Sonic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Henselite Tiger and the Aero Sonic are highly comparable models of lawn bowls that are well-suited for outdoor play and can be found in a range of sizes for the UK market. However, the primary difference is that the Henselite Tiger can be harder to find on online second-hand marketplaces, while the Aero Sonic is a relatively new addition to the market that may not be as widely available. Ultimately, both models offer high performance and quality for lawn bowls enthusiasts, and choosing between them may simply come down to personal preference or availability.</p>
