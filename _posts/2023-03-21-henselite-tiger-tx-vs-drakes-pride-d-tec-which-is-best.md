<p>That's why I'm here to help. In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at two popular models - the Henselite Tiger TX and the Drakes Pride D-TEC.

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2732} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX is a narrow biased lawn bowl primarily designed for indoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or lead players on fast outdoor greens. The model is available in sizes 00 to 5, specifically for the UK market, and is mostly sold new in stores as it is hard to find on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC is a narrow biased lawn bowl, suitable for indoor play and lead position on fast outdoor greens. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 and is primarily marketed in the UK. While it may be difficult to find second-hand, purchasing new may be necessary for those interested in this model.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger TX and Drakes Pride D-TEC are narrow biased bowls that are recommended for indoor rinks. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2835} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger TX is the narrowest biased bowl in the Henselite range, while the D-TEC is the narrowest biased bowl in the Drakes Pride range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between these two bowls is that the D-TEC is also suitable for fast outdoor greens, whereas the Tiger TX should be avoided if you primarily play outdoors in the UK. Both bowls are designed for indoor bowlers, but the D-TEC may be a better choice for those who occasionally play outdoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the bias of these two bowls is quite similar, but the D-TEC offers more versatility for different types of playing surfaces. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to consider your personal preferences and playing habits when choosing between these two bowls.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger TX and Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowls have different grip options. The Henselite Tiger TX comes with an embedded grip known as the Henselite Mega grip, while the Drakes Pride D-TEC only offers their standard dimple grip. The Henselite Mega grip is set deeper into the bowl, which can make it feel smaller in your hand. This is beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl correctly. On the other hand, the dimple grip is a classic style of grip with small divots running along the shoulder of the bowl. This allows bowlers to place their fingertips in the dimples, providing a better grip on the bowl. Ultimately, both grips offer their own unique advantages and disadvantages, and the best option will depend on the bowler's personal preference and skill level.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If budget is a major consideration when shopping for lawn bowls, then the Drakes Pride D-TEC is the more affordable option. With a price range of £120-200 for a second-hand set and £290 for a brand new set, it is a bit more budget-friendly than the Henselite Tiger TX.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, while the Henselite Tiger TX is the more expensive option, it is worth noting that it is an investment in terms of performance and longevity. For £420, you get a set of lawn bowls that are durable, reliable, and can last you for years to come. Additionally, you can purchase a set of used Tiger TX bowls for around £260-310, which is still more expensive than the Drakes Pride D-TEC but significantly more affordable than buying a brand new set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, whether you choose to go with the Drakes Pride D-TEC or the Henselite Tiger TX would depend on your budget and what you value more - affordability or quality/performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger TX and the Drakes Pride D-TEC are narrow-biased bowls that are best suited for indoor bowlers. However, the Henselite Tiger TX is specifically designed for indoor use and may not perform optimally on outdoor surfaces. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride D-TEC can also be used on faster outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both bowls are highly recommended for bowlers who frequently play the lead position. However, individuals who prioritize indoor play and require a highly specialized bowl may prefer the Henselite Tiger TX. Meanwhile, those who require a versatile option that can be used in both indoor and outdoor settings may opt for the Drakes Pride D-TEC. Ultimately, the choice between these two popular models depends on an individual's unique playing style and preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Henselite Tiger TX and the Drakes Pride D-TEC are great options for indoor bowlers and those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. Both are narrow biased and come in a range of sizes. However, it seems that both models are difficult to find on online second hand marketplaces, so purchasing them new may be necessary. Ultimately, the choice between these two models may come down to personal preference, so it's important for bowlers to try out both before making a final decision.</p>
