<p>We'll be looking at everything from the specs to the price, so you can make an informed decision about which one is right for you. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a beginner, this guide will help you find the perfect lawn bowl to suit your needs. So let's dive in!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2719} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. It is suitable for all outdoor surfaces and is preferred by skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, the Henselite Tiger is a highly sought-after bowl that is only available new, as it is challenging to find on secondhand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC is a narrow biased lawn bowl designed for indoor play, and is best suited for indoor bowlers or lead players on fast outdoor greens. This model is only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, and may be difficult to find second hand online. However, the D-TEC is highly regarded by those who use it for its precision and accuracy on the green.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger and Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowls have different biases, with the Tiger being wide biased and the D-TEC being narrow biased. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2828} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger is ideal for outdoor greens, while the D-TEC is suitable for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. The Tiger should be avoided if you play mainly indoors, while the D-TEC should be avoided if you play predominantly outdoors in the UK. </p>

<p>The bowl you choose will depend heavily on where you bowl - outdoors? The Tiger is the choice. Indoors? then the D-TEC is much more for you.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger lawn bowl comes with an embedded grip called Henselite Mega grip, making the bowl feel smaller in your hand. This is an advantage for bowlers with difficulties gripping the bowl. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowl only offers their standard dimple grip, a classic style where small divots run along the shoulder of the bowl. This allows your finger tips to sit in the dimples, providing a better grip. Each grip has its own benefits, depending on individual bowlers' preferences and needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Henselite Tiger and the Drakes Pride D-TEC have different grip options, with the former offering an embedded grip and the latter a classic dimple grip. For bowlers who need extra assistance in gripping the bowl, the Henselite Tiger's embedded grip might be the better choice. While for those who prefer the classic style of grip, the Drakes Pride D-TEC's standard dimple grip will suit them well. It is ultimately up to the bowler to decide which grip would best serve their game.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the price of lawn bowls, the Henselite Tiger is definitely on the higher end of the spectrum. At around £400 for a brand new set, it's significantly more expensive than the Drakes Pride D-TEC which can be bought new for around £290. However, it's worth noting that the Tiger II can be bought second hand for a lower price of around £200-690. Meanwhile, second hand D-TECs can be found for around £120-200.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the price difference between the two models will depend on personal preference and budget. While the Henselite Tiger may be pricier, some bowlers may prefer its features and design. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride D-TEC offers a less expensive alternative without sacrificing too much in terms of quality. It's important to weigh the pros and cons of each model before making a decision, and to consider both the initial cost and any potential savings from buying second hand.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger and Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowls are designed for different types of bowlers. The Henselite Tiger is best suited for outdoor play due to its wide bias, making it a great option for those who play outdoor lawn bowls exclusively. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride D-TEC is optimal for indoor bowlers who require a narrow bias. Additionally, the D-TEC can be played on faster outdoor surfaces, making it versatile for those who participate in both indoor and outdoor games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is also worth noting that the D-TEC is particularly advantageous for lead players, as its narrow bias allows greater control over shots. In contrast, the Henselite Tiger may not be ideal for this position due to its wider bias. Ultimately, the decision between these two lawn bowls will depend on the individual’s playing style, preferred surfaces and position, making it important to carefully consider these factors before making a purchase.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After comparing the Henselite Tiger and the Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowls, it is clear that they both have their own benefits for specific types of play. The Henselite Tiger is perfect for outdoor surfaces and ideal for skips, while the Drakes Pride D-TEC is better suited for indoor play and for those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. Both bowls are only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and can be hard to find on online marketplaces. Ultimately, the choice between these two popular models of lawn bowls will depend on individual preferences and playing style.</p>
