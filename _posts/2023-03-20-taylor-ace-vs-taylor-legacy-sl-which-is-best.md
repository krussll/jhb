<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2690} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace is a multi-purpose lawn bowl that is suitable for indoor and outdoor gameplay, thanks to its mid-bias design. It's a versatile bowl that can handle a range of playing surfaces and environments. The Ace is available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market, making it suitable for a wide range of players. Additionally, those looking for a budget-friendly option may find the Taylor Ace on online second-hand marketplaces, such as eBay. Overall, the Taylor Ace is a well-rounded choice for those seeking a reliable lawn bowl.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL model of lawn bowls is designed for outdoor play and has a wide bias that makes it well-suited for skips. It can be used on all outdoor surfaces and comes in sizes ranging from 00 to 5, although it is only available in the UK market. Additionally, this bowl can be found on second-hand marketplaces like eBay. Overall, the Taylor Legacy SL seems like a solid option for those who play outdoor lawn bowls and want a wide-biased bowl that is ideal for skips.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of the Taylor Legacy SL and the Taylor Ace lawn bowl is their degree of bias. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2814} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Legacy SL is a wide-biased bowl, which means the bowl has a strong curvature and is designed to be used mainly on outdoor greens. On the other hand, the Ace has a mid-biased design, which means it has a moderate curve and can be used on both indoor and outdoor surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another difference between these two lawn bowls is their place within the Taylor range. The Ace sits between the Blaze and the International, while the Legacy SL falls between the International and the Lignoid. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This suggests that the Ace may be better suited for intermediate players, while the Legacy SL may be more appropriate for experienced players looking for a stronger curve on outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2811} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice between these two lawn bowls should consider where the majority of the game will be played, the experience level of the player, and personal playing preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace lawn bowl offers a choice between the Progrip and the Taylor Xtreme grip, both of which cater to different preferences of grip. The Progrip is a top-class dimple grip, whereas the Xtreme grip is an embedded grip. In contrast, the Taylor Legacy SL comes with the Progrip as standard and does not offer the option of an embedded grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While an embedded grip can be advantageous for bowlers who have difficulty gripping the bowl, a dimple grip is a classic style that offers small divots along the shoulder of the bowl to improve grip. Both grips have their benefits, and which one is better depends on personal preference and comfort while playing. Overall, both Taylor Ace and Legacy SL provide top-quality grips that cater to a variety of bowlers' needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the price of the Taylor Ace and Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowls, it's clear that the Taylor Legacy SL is the more affordable option. You can get a new Legacy SL for £290, which is significantly lower than the Ace's price of £360 for a new set. Even if you opt for a second-hand set, the Legacy SL is still cheaper, with prices ranging from £100-£160 compared to the Ace's £160-£230.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the price isn't the only factor to consider when choosing between these two models. The Ace is often regarded as the premium option, with its Progrip and ProTaylor finish offering superior handling and performance. Meanwhile, the Legacy SL is designed for a wider range of players, offering a mid-bias performance that can help beginners improve their game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between the Taylor Ace and Taylor Legacy SL will depend on your budget, skill level, and personal preferences. While the Ace may offer slightly better performance, it comes with a higher price tag, and for some players, the Legacy SL may offer all the quality they need at a more accessible price point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on their respective features, the Taylor Ace and the Taylor Legacy SL are best suited for different types of players. The Taylor Ace, being mid-biased and versatile for indoor and outdoor play, would be an excellent choice for beginners who are still learning to control the bowl's trajectory. It would also suit intermediate players who play across a wide range of surfaces, as they can rely on the mid-bias to give them a reasonable level of accuracy regardless of the conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Taylor Legacy SL is targeted towards experienced players who specialize in playing on outdoor surfaces. The wide bias of the bowl provides a significant level of curvature, making it suitable for players who are confident in their ability to master the art of controlling the bowl's path. While the Legacy SL would not be ideal for indoor play, it is an excellent option for those who compete in outdoor tournaments and who regularly play on grass, as the wide bias can help compensate for the variations in the surface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Taylor Ace and the Taylor Legacy SL will depend on several factors, including the player's level of experience, playing style, and preferred playing surface. However, both models are high-quality options that are likely to appeal to a broad range of lawn bowlers.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Taylor Ace and Taylor Legacy SL are both popular models of lawn bowls with their own unique strengths. The Taylor Ace is a more versatile bowl suited for both indoor and outdoor play, while the Taylor Legacy SL is best for outdoor play on a variety of surfaces, making it a great option for skips. Both bowls are available in sizes 00 to 5 and can be found on online second-hand marketplaces. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on personal preference and specific playing conditions.</p>
