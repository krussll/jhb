<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer is a lawn bowl model suitable for indoor play or fast outdoor greens. Its bias is narrow, ranging from sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market. The Lazer is ideal for indoor bowlers or those who primarily play lead position in faster outdoor greens. This model is available for purchase online, including second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<p>The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow biased bowl designed for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, and it can sometimes be difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay. Overall, the Tiger II is a high-quality option for those looking for a narrow bias bowl.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger II and the Taylor Lazer have a narrow bias, making them suitable for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. However, there are some differences between the two. The Taylor Lazer is the narrowest biased bowl in the Taylor range, and it is recommended for indoor bowlers or those who predominantly play on fast outdoor greens. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger II is positioned between the Tiger TX and the Tiger Pro in the Henselite range, and it is suitable for both indoor and lead outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Henselite Tiger II and the Taylor Lazer have specific features that suit different types of bowlers and conditions. So, it's important to carefully consider one's needs and preferences before choosing either of the two lawn bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II comes with an embedded grip, while the Taylor Lazer has a dimple grip known as the Progrip. An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl and can help bowlers who have trouble gripping it properly. In contrast, a dimple grip provides small divots along the shoulder of the bowl for better finger tip grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Taylor Lazer does not provide the option of an embedded grip, the Progrip is still regarded as one of the best dimple grips around. However, if a bowler has a specific preference for an embedded grip, the Henselite Tiger II may be the better option. Ultimately, the choice between the two models would depend on the individual bowler's preference and playing style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the two popular models of lawn bowls, the Taylor Lazer and the Henselite Tiger II, it is clear that the Taylor Lazer is considerably cheaper, with a new set costing around £290 and second hand ones selling for £150-£170. In comparison, the Henselite Tiger II is much more expensive, with a new set costing around £420 and second hand ones selling for £200-£290.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This price difference may be due to factors such as the popularity and reputation of each brand, the materials used to create each model, and the manufacturing processes involved. It is important to note, however, that the cost of a lawn bowl should not be the only factor considered when making a purchase. The quality, performance, and suitability of the bowl for the individual player's needs should also be taken into account. Ultimately, the decision of which bowl to purchase should be based on a combination of factors, including price, quality, and personal preference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Lazer and the Henselite Tiger II are narrow biased lawn bowls that are ideal for indoor bowlers who frequently play lead positions. However, there are some differences between the two models that may make one more suitable than the other depending on the particular bowler and playing surface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer is specifically designed for indoor play and may not perform as well on outdoor surfaces. It is also specifically aimed at bowlers who tend to play lead positions. On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger II is also considered an indoor bowl but can be played on faster outdoor surfaces. Like the Taylor Lazer, it is ideal for bowlers who play lead positions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, who would these bowls best suit? For those who primarily bowl indoors and frequently play lead, either the Taylor Lazer or the Henselite Tiger II could be a suitable choice. However, for bowlers who play primarily outdoors, the Henselite Tiger II may be a better option due to its ability to perform on faster outdoor surfaces. Ultimately, the choice between these two bowls will come down to the individual needs and preferences of the bowler.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Lazer and the Henselite Tiger II are narrow biased bowls ideal for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. Both are available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only. However, while the Taylor Lazer is more commonly found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay, the Henselite Tiger II can be a bit trickier to find. Ultimately, the choice between these two models may come down to personal preference and availability. Regardless of which one you choose, both are popular and reliable options for lawn bowls players.</p>
