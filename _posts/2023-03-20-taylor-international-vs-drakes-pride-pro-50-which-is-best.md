<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 is a versatile mid-biased lawn bowl that is suitable for indoor and outdoor play on a variety of surfaces and conditions. It is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only and can be found on online second hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International and Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowls have different biases but are both mid-biased. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2824} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The International is designed for use on outdoor greens and suited to all outdoor surfaces. It sits between the Ace and Legacy models in the Taylor range. The PRO-50, on the other hand, has the same mid-bias as the Professional bowl but with deeper grip, making it ideal for indoor rinks as well as outdoor greens. The PRO-50 falls between the D-TEC and XP in the Drakes Pride range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Taylor International is wider biased than the Drakes Pride PRO-50. This difference makes them suited to different surfaces and environments. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2796} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The International is an excellent choice for outdoor greens, while the PRO-50 is suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowlers. Bowlers must consider the differences in bias and grip when choosing between the two models, based on their intended use and preferences.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 both offer unique grip options. The Taylor International comes with the standard Taylor Progrip, which is a dimple grip that provides excellent grip for most bowlers. However, it does not offer an embedded grip option, which is considered better for those with gripping issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offers an embedded grip option, which is set deeper into the bowl and makes it feel smaller in your hand. This is a great option for bowlers who struggle with proper grip. Although the PRO-50 also offers a classic dimple grip option, the embedded grip is a standout feature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Taylor International and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 grips will depend on personal preference and individual needs. Bowlers who prefer a classic dimple grip may opt for the Taylor International, while those who need a deeper grip could benefit from the embedded grip option on the Drakes Pride PRO-50.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the price comparison between two popular models of lawn bowls, the Taylor International seems to be the more expensive option. A new set of Taylor International lawn bowls will set you back £360, while the Drakes Pride PRO-50 can be bought new for around £300. However, it's worth noting that the prices for second-hand bowls can vary greatly, with the Taylor International ranging between £100-£190 and the PRO-50 between £190-£260.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While price is an important factor to consider when choosing lawn bowls, it's not the only one. Each brand has its own unique features and benefits that may appeal to different players. For example, Taylor International is known for its performance on faster greens and has a wider range of sizes and weights available, while the Drakes Pride PRO-50 is praised for its stability and consistency on a variety of surfaces. Ultimately, the decision will come down to personal preference and playing style.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to the choice between the Taylor International and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowls, it really depends on where you'll be playing most of the time. If you're primarily playing outdoors, then the Taylor International would likely be the better option. Its mid-bias design makes it well-suited for outdoor terrain, and it performs well on all surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, if you'll be playing both indoor and outdoor bowls, then the Drakes Pride PRO-50 would be the better choice. It too is a mid-bias design, but it's specifically designed to work well on both indoor and outdoor surfaces. This makes it a versatile option that can be used in a wider range of playing environments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two popular lawn bowl models will come down to personal preference and playing style. However, knowing where you'll be playing most frequently can help you narrow down your options and choose the best bowl for you.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor International and Drakes Pride PRO-50 are versatile and reliable lawn bowls that can be used on different surfaces and conditions. While the Taylor International has a mid-to-wide bias, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 has a mid-bias, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. Both models are available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and can be found on online second-hand marketplaces.
