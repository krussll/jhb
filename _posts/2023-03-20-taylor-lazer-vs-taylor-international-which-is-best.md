<p>I'll be taking a look at the specs, bias, grip, price, and who they're best suited for. By the end of our time together, you'll have a much clearer picture of which lawn bowl will work best for you. Let's jump right in!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer is a model of lawn bowls with a narrow bias, which makes it ideal for indoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. The Taylor Lazer is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. It can also be found on online secondhand marketplaces such as eBay. These specifications make the Taylor Lazer a great option for those looking for a specialized bowl for a particular type of play.</p>

<p>The Taylor International is a mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl that is designed for outdoor play. It is a versatile bowl that can be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, the Taylor International can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. Overall, this bowl is a great option for lawn bowls enthusiasts looking for a reliable and versatile option for their outdoor play.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the Taylor International and the Taylor Lazer lawn bowls is their bias. The Lazer is narrow biased, making it ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens, while the International is mid to wide biased, making it suitable for all outdoor surfaces. The Lazer bowl is the narrowest biased bowl in the Taylor range, while the International is between the Ace and Legacy models.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To summarize, if you primarily play indoors or on fast outdoor greens, the Lazer would be a better choice due to its narrow bias. However, if you play predominantly outdoors or on a variety of surfaces, the International bowl with its mid to wide bias would be the more versatile option. Ultimately, choosing the right lawn bowl depends on your personal preference and the conditions in which you typically play.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor International lawn bowls come with the Taylor Progrip as standard, which is a dimple grip and one of the best in the market. However, neither of them offers an embedded grip option, which is preferable for bowlers who struggle to grip the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The difference between an embedded grip and a dimple grip is that the embedded grip sits deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand, while the dimple grip has small divots running along the shoulder of the bowl where your fingertips sit for a better grip. Ultimately, choosing between the two grips, comes down to personal preference and comfort for individual bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor International lawn bowls, it is clear that the Taylor Lazer is the more affordable option. At £290 for a new set, it is significantly cheaper than the £360 cost of a new set of Taylor International bowls. Even when looking at second-hand options, the Taylor Lazer still comes out on top with a price range of £150-£170, compared to the £100-£190 range for the Taylor International.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is worth noting, however, that the higher cost of the Taylor International may be reflected in its quality and performance. The International model is made with a more dense and precise manufacturing process, resulting in a bowl that is more consistent and accurate on the green. The Lazer, on the other hand, may be a better option for those who are just starting out with lawn bowls and do not want to make a significant investment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor International will depend on individual needs and preferences. While the Lazer may be more affordable, the International may offer a higher level of performance and durability. It is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each before making a decision.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After comparing the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor International, it is clear that each model is designed to suit different types of bowlers. The Taylor Lazer is more suitable for indoor bowlers who play lead frequently due to its narrow bias, while the Taylor International is more versatile and can be used on all surfaces, making it ideal for outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the Taylor International is a mid-biased bowl, which means it offers a more balanced performance and is easier to control when playing on outdoor surfaces. Meanwhile, the Taylor Lazer’s bias is better suited for indoor surfaces where there is less wind and movement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, if you are an indoor bowler who primarily plays lead, the Taylor Lazer would be the ideal option for you. However, if you enjoy playing outdoors and want a more versatile bowl, the Taylor International would be the better choice. It all comes down to your individual playing style and preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor International are high-quality lawn bowls from one of the most renowned manufacturers in the industry. However, they have distinct differences that make them suited for different playing conditions and player preferences. While the Lazer is best for indoor play and a fast outdoor greens, the International is a versatile bowl that excels in outdoor play on different surfaces and conditions.
