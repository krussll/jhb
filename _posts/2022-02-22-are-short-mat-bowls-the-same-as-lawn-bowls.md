<p>Short mat bowls is a popular format for many lawn bowlers in the off season. It's something that can be played socially indoors in the evenings whilst the weather is grey and wet - and can be played alongside other popular “off-season” pursuits such as the full indoor game or (at least true in my neck of the woods) skittles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But for those not familiar with the game there are some concerns about needing to double up on equipment. This obviously isn;t true for shoes or clothing - as any valid <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/rules-of-short-mat-bowls/">bowls shoes will be fine for short mat</a>. The main concern is with the bowls themselves. Can a bowler use the same set they use for the outdoor and/or indoor game? Or are there special bowls purely for short mat?</p>

<p>Let's look at this in a bit more detail.</p>

<h2><a href="#are-short-mat-bowls-different-to-lawn-bowls"></a>Are Short Mat Bowls different to lawn bowls?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Any set of lawn bowls would be acceptable for playing short mat bowls. There are no special requirements that require a different set of bowls that are different to an outdoor or indoor set of bowls.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Short mat bowls should not be confused with carpet bowls, which is a very different game. Carpet bowls are much smaller than those used in the “full scale” game (i.e. outdoor, indoor, or short mat bowls).</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any set of outdoor bowls will be fine for the short mat version of the game. However, popular mid-biased models are the most popular by bowlers.</p>

<h2><a href="#what-size-are-short-mat-bowls"></a>What size are short mat bowls?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The size of a short mat bowl will depend on the size you get. Size are labelled in numeric order and range from 000 to 5 (smallest to largest). The diameter of a short mat bowl starts at 112mm and goes up to 127mm. The weight of a short mat bowl ranges from 1.075kg to 1.58kg - again depending on the size used.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The size of bowl required will depend on the size of the hands of the bowler. As a guide, you go to the biggest size you can comfortably hold. A great test for this is if you can wrap both hands around the running surface of the bowl and have your middle fingers and thumbs touch at either side.</p>

<h2><a href="#are-carpet-bowls-the-same-as-lawn-bowls"></a>Are carpet bowls the same as lawn bowls?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, carpet bowls are not the same as lawn bowls. This is a common misconception as carpet bowls is often confused with short mat bowls, the two are very different games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A carpet bowl is much smaller than a lawn bowl - roughly 60% the size of an average lawn bowl. Carpet bowls only come in one size, again different from <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/what-size-lawn-bowl-should-i-use/">lawn bowls which come in many sizes</a> depending on the needs of the bowler.</p>

<h2><a href="#conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In short (excuse the pun) lawn bowls can be used for indoor, outdoor, or short mat bowls. There is much crossover between the three games and a good set of mid-biased bowls would be ideal for playing all three.</p>
