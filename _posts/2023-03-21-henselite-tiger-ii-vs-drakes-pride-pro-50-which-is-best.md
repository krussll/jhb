<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2728} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow-biased lawn bowl designed for indoor and fast outdoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only and may be difficult to find on second-hand marketplaces. It is recommended to purchase the set brand new.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 is a highly versatile lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. With a mid-biased design, it can be used on various surfaces and conditions. This model is available in sizes 00 to 5, although only in the UK market. Moreover, it can be found on online marketplaces, such as eBay, including second-hand options.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the bias of the Henselite Tiger II and the Drakes Pride PRO-50, one key difference is the level of bias. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2831} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger II is a narrow biased bowl, ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. In contrast, the PRO-50 is a mid-biased bowl, suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowlers. While the Tiger II is designed for lead outdoor bowlers and indoor bowlers, the PRO-50 has a deeper grip and is suited for a wider range of bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another difference between the two bowls is their position in their company's range. The Tiger II is between the Tiger TX and the Tiger Pro, while the PRO-50 falls between the D-TEC and XP in the Drakes Pride range. This suggests that the Tiger II is more specialized, designed for specific conditions and skill levels, while the PRO-50 offers a middle ground that can be adapted to different environments.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the bias of these two lawn bowls reflects their different design priorities and intended uses. The Tiger II is a highly responsive bowl for particular conditions, while the PRO-50 prioritizes versatility and a stable bias across different environments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger II and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 come with an embedded grip option. This means the grip is set deeper into the bowl which can make it feel smaller in your hand, making it easier for bowlers who struggle to grip the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Henselite Tiger II exclusively comes with the Henselite Mega grip as standard, while the Drakes Pride PRO-50 offers various grip options, including their embedded grip and a classic dimple grip. The dimple grip is designed with small divots along the shoulder of the bowl to provide better grip for the fingertips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the two grips depends on personal preference and individual needs. Bowlers should consider their hand size and grip strength to determine which grip is right for them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Henselite Tiger II is more expensive than the Drakes Pride PRO-50. The Tiger II can be purchased brand new for around £420, while the PRO-50 is available new for around £300. However, if you're shopping for a used bowl, then the PRO-50 may be the more affordable choice, as it can be found for as little as £190, while the Tiger II ranges from around £200-290.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's worth noting that price isn't everything when it comes to lawn bowls. While the Tiger II may carry a higher price tag, it's a popular choice among professional bowlers, thanks to its precision and reliability. Meanwhile, the PRO-50 has been known for its comfort and reliable line tracking. Ultimately, the decision between these two popular models of lawn bowls should be based on your own personal preferences and playing style, as well as your budget.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 are both popular models of lawn bowls, but they have different characteristics that make them suitable for certain types of bowlers. The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow biased bowl that is ideal for indoor bowlers and players who often play lead. It can also be played on faster outdoor surfaces, but it is not as versatile as the Drakes Pride PRO-50.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 is a mid-biased bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor surfaces. Its versatility makes it a popular choice among bowlers who play on different types of greens. If you are looking for a lawn bowl that can be played in different conditions and suits a range of playing styles, then the Drakes Pride PRO-50 is a great option. On the other hand, if you primarily play indoor bowls and want a bowl with a narrow bias, then the Henselite Tiger II may be a better choice.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Henselite Tiger II and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 are great options for lawn bowling enthusiasts. However, if you're looking for a more versatile bowl that can be used both indoors and outdoors, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 is the way to go. It also has the added advantage of being readily available on online second hand marketplaces. On the other hand, if you're specifically looking for a narrow biased bowl for indoor play and fast outdoor greens, the Henselite Tiger II would be a better choice. Ultimately, it all comes down to personal preference and the specific needs of the bowler.</p>
