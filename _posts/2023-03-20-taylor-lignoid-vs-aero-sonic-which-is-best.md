<p>In this blog post, I'll be comparing two popular models, the Taylor Lignoid and the Aero Sonic. We'll be looking at the spec of the bowls, the bias, the available grip options, the price, and who each bowl is best suited for. By the end of this guide, you'll have all the information you need to confidently choose the right lawn bowl for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid is a wide biased lawn bowl model that is suitable for outdoor play. It is an ideal choice for all outdoor surfaces and is especially suited for skips. Available in the UK market in sizes 00 to 5, the Taylor Lignoid can be found on second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Sonic is a wide biased lawn bowl suitable for outdoor play on various surfaces. It is particularly well-suited for skips and comes in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. While it may be difficult to find second-hand options online, the Aero Sonic is readily available new.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lignoid and Aero Sonic lawn bowls are designed for outdoor greens and are wide-biased, making them ideal for players who prefer a bowl with a significant amount of curve. However, the Taylor Lignoid is wider than the Aero Sonic and is recommended for use on outdoor greens exclusively, while the Sonic can be used on all surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That being said, the bias of these lawn bowls can ultimately come down to personal preference and playing style. Some players may find the wider bias of the Lignoid more suitable for their game, while others may prefer a slightly less biased option like the Aero Sonic. It's important for players to try out different types of lawn bowls to determine which one works best for their game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Sonic offers more grip options than the Taylor Lignoid, including a dimple, embedded grip, and non-gripped option, all of which come as standard without any additional cost. On the other hand, the Taylor Lignoid only comes with the Taylor Progrip as standard, which is a dimple grip and is known to be one of the best around. However, the Lignoid does not offer the option of an embedded grip, which some bowlers may prefer as it makes the bowl feel smaller in their hand, which is beneficial for those who have difficulty gripping the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while the Taylor Lignoid has a high-quality dimple grip, the Aero Sonic wins in terms of grip options and customization. The ability to choose among different types of grips without any extra cost is a significant advantage for bowlers who are looking for a bowl that caters to their specific needs and preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to lawn bowls, both the Taylor Lignoid and the Aero Sonic are popular choices. However, there are some key differences in terms of price. The Taylor Lignoid is generally more affordable, with a new set available for around £290 and second-hand sets costing between £90-£130.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Aero Sonic is pricier, with a new set costing around £400. Second-hand sets are rare, but if you do manage to find them, you can expect to pay between £300-£360.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the price alone should not be the only deciding factor when choosing between these two models. There are other features to consider, such as the weight and grip of the bowls. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the Taylor Lignoid may be a more budget-friendly option for those on a tight budget.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lignoid and the Aero Sonic are popular choices for lawn bowlers, but they have different features that make them suitable for different players. The Taylor Lignoid is a wide biased bowl, best suited for outdoor play. It is not suitable for indoor use. In contrast, the Aero Sonic is an outdoor bowl that can be played with in multiple positions in a team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Generally speaking, if you are an outdoor bowler who loves to play with a wide biased bowl, the Taylor Lignoid would be the best option for you. However, if your main focus is playing in a team and having the flexibility to play with different bowls, including an outdoor bowl, then the Aero Sonic would be a better fit. Ultimately, the choice of which bowl to use comes down to personal preference and playing style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Aero Sonic and the Taylor Lignoid are great options for lawn bowl players who prefer a wide biased bowl for outdoor play. However, while the Taylor Lignoid can be easily found on platforms like eBay, the Aero Sonic is less readily available and is mostly sold new. Both bowls are suited to a range of outdoor surfaces and are great options for skips. Ultimately, the decision between the two will come down to personal preference, but both are excellent choices for avid lawn bowl players looking to improve their game.</p>
