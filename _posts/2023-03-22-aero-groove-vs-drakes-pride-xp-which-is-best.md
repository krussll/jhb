<!-- wp:block {"ref":2703} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero GrooVe is a mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. This versatile bowl can be used on a range of surfaces and conditions, making it a great choice for lawn bowl enthusiasts looking for adaptability in their equipment. Available in sizes 00 to 5 exclusively for the UK market, the Aero GrooVe can be hard to come by in second-hand online marketplaces, so purchasing new is likely the best option. Overall, the Aero GrooVe is a solid choice for players looking for a bowl with reliable performance across a variety of playing environments.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride XP is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. It is suitable for all outdoor surfaces and is particularly well-suited for skips. The bowls are available in sizes 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. Although it is difficult to find the Drakes Pride XP on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay, purchasing new is a viable option.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the Drakes Pride XP and the Aero GrooVe lawn bowls is their bias. The XP is a wide biased bowl, while the GrooVe is a mid-biased bowl. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2822} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This means that the XP will have a stronger curve and be more suited to outdoor greens, while the GrooVe is better for indoor rinks and outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the XP is the widest bowl in the Drakes Pride range, while the GrooVe is situated between the Quantum and the Sonic in the Aero range. Both bowls are suitable for outdoor surfaces, but the XP is specifically designed for outdoor greens.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, the choice between the Drakes Pride XP and the Aero GrooVe is dependent on the player's preference and the surface they will be playing on. The XP is better suited for players looking for a wider curve on outdoor greens, while the GrooVe's mid-bias makes it ideal for a variety of surfaces, including indoor rinks and outdoor greens.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grip options, the Aero GrooVe clearly offers more variety compared to the Drakes Pride XP. With options such as a dimple, embedded grip or no grip at all, the Aero GrooVe caters to a wider range of preferences. Additionally, Aero offers their grips as standard, meaning no extra costs for those who want to customize their bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the Drakes Pride XP only comes with their standard dimple grip. While this grip style is a classic and may suit some bowlers, it lacks the range and flexibility that the Aero GrooVe provides. However, Drakes Pride does offer an embedded grip option which can be beneficial for those who struggle with grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Aero provides the superior grip options between the two models. However, it ultimately comes down to personal preference and what feels most comfortable in the bowler's hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between the Aero GrooVe and the Drakes Pride XP lawn bowls, there is a notable difference in price. The Aero GrooVe, both new and second-hand, generally costs more than the Drakes Pride XP. A new set of Aero GrooVe's can set you back around £400, while a second-hand set typically ranges from £300-£360. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride XP is sold new for around £290, and second-hand for approximately £140-£250.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the price difference between the two models may be significant for some individuals, it is important to consider a variety of factors when deciding which lawn bowls to invest in. These may include the size and weight of the bowls, their suitability for certain types of greens, and the grip or handling of the bowls. Ultimately, the choice between the Aero GrooVe and the Drakes Pride XP will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the bowler.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are a lawn bowler who enjoys playing both indoor and outdoor games and prefers a versatile bowl, then the Aero GrooVe would be best for you. This bowl can be used in different positions in a team and is suitable for both indoor and outdoor games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, if you are an outdoor game enthusiast and are not keen on playing indoors, then the Drakes Pride XP would be the perfect choice for you. This bowl has a wide bias, making it ideal for outdoor games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, the choice between the two models depends on the preferences of the player. If you play both indoor and outdoor games, and want a versatile bowl, go for the Aero GrooVe.
