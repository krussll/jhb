<p>That's why in this blog post, I'm going to take a closer look at two popular models: the Taylor Blaze and the Henselite Tiger Pro. I'll compare their specs, bias, grip options, price, and determine who they're best suited for. By the end, you'll have a clearer idea of which bowl is right for you. So, let's dive in!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze is a versatile mid-biased lawn bowl that can be used for both indoor and outdoor play. It is suitable for various playing surfaces and conditions, making it a popular choice among players. Available in sizes 00 to 5 and exclusive to the UK market, the Taylor Blaze can also be found on online second-hand marketplaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro lawn bowls are a top-of-the-line option for bowlers looking for versatility in playing surfaces. With a mid-bias and a range of available sizes, these bowls excel both indoors and outdoors. However, they come at a significant cost and may be hard to find on the secondhand market. Overall, the Henselite Tiger Pro is a high-quality choice for experienced bowlers looking for a reliable and adaptable set of lawn bowls.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Blaze and the Henselite Tiger Pro lawn bowls are mid-biased and suitable for indoor and outdoor play. The Blaze sits between the Vector VS and the Ace, while the Tiger Pro fits between the Tiger and Tiger II models. The Blaze is ideal for indoor rinks and outdoor greens, while the Tiger Pro is suitable for all outdoor greens as well as indoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both bowls are versatile and suitable for a range of bowlers. However, the Blaze may be better suited for those who play primarily indoors, while the Tiger Pro is ideal for those who play both indoors and outdoors. Both bowls are similar in bias but have slight differences that may appeal to different players depending on their specific needs and preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of grip, the Taylor Blaze and Henselite Tiger Pro have different options. The Taylor Blaze comes with the Taylor Premier grip, which is similar to the popular Progrip but has oblong dimples. The Henselite Tiger Pro, on the other hand, comes with an embedded grip called the Henselite Mega grip, which sits deeper into the bowl and can help bowlers who struggle with grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Taylor Blaze doesn't offer an embedded grip option, its dimple grip is a classic and effective style that can provide a solid grip. Ultimately, the choice between the two will come down to personal preference and any specific grip issues a bowler may have.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Henselite Tiger Pro is slightly more expensive than the Taylor Blaze. Brand new, the Tiger Pro sells for around £400 while the Blaze can be purchased for £360. However, it is possible to find both models second hand for more affordable prices. Buyers can expect to pay around £210-£230 for a used set of Taylor Blaze and around £250-£300 for a used set of Henselite Tiger Pro.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the price difference may not be significant, it is worth noting that the Taylor Blaze is slightly more budget-friendly than the Tiger Pro. This may be important for beginners or those who are hesitant to invest significant amounts of money in their lawn bowls equipment. However, it is important to consider that price shouldn't be the only deciding factor when choosing between the two models. Other factors like grip, weight, and bias should also be taken into account to ensure the best performance on the green.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When considering who the Taylor Blaze and Henselite Tiger Pro would best suit, it largely comes down to personal preference and playing style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Blaze's mid-bias makes it a great choice for those who prefer a consistent and reliable delivery on a variety of surfaces. It also performs well in windy conditions compared to more biased bowls. This makes it a good option for novice or intermediate players who want a versatile bowl for both indoor and outdoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Henselite Tiger Pro is designed with dual-purpose use in mind. This bowl is well-suited for players who regularly switch between indoor and outdoor games. It also offers the flexibility to be played in multiple positions within a team, making it ideal for competitive players who need to adapt to different roles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, it's important to try out both models and see which one feels most comfortable and effective for your individual playing style. Experienced players may have more specific preferences based on their technique and the specific conditions of their usual play location.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Blaze and the Henselite Tiger Pro are excellent lawn bowls that are perfect for indoor and outdoor play. However, the Taylor Blaze appears to be more widely available and less expensive, whereas the Henselite Tiger Pro is more difficult to find and comparatively higher in price. Ultimately, the choice between the two will likely depend on personal preference and budget. Regardless of which model you choose, both the Taylor Blaze and the Henselite Tiger Pro are excellent options for bowlers who want a versatile and reliable lawn bowl.</p>
