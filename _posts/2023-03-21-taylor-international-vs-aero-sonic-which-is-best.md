<p>To make things easier for you, let me introduce you to two of the most popular models: the Taylor International and the Aero Sonic. In this blog post, I’ll compare the specifications, bias, grip options, price, and suitability of these two bowl models. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a clear idea of which bowl is the perfect match for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2706} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International lawn bowl is a mid-to-wide bias bowl that is best suited for outdoor play. It is highly versatile and can be used on a range of surfaces and conditions. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5, but it is only sold in the UK market. It can be found on online second-hand marketplaces, such as eBay. Overall, the Taylor International is an excellent choice for lawn bowlers looking for a reliable and adaptable bowl.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Sonic is an ideal lawn bowl for outdoor play, featuring wide bias that is perfect for skips. It is suitable for all types of outdoor surfaces and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only. While it may be difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay, it is recommended to purchase the Aero Sonic brand new for optimal performance.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of bias, both the Aero Sonic and Taylor International lawn bowls are mid-biased/wide biased and suitable for outdoor greens on all surfaces. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2824} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Taylor International is positioned between the Ace and the Legacy in the Taylor range while the Aero Sonic is the widest bowl in the Aero range. This suggests that the Aero Sonic may have a slightly wider bias than the Taylor International.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while both bowls have similar characteristics regarding bias and suitability for outdoor greens, the Aero Sonic may be more advantageous for those who prefer a wider bias. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2833} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it ultimately depends on the individual player's preference and playing style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of the Taylor International and the Aero Sonic lawn bowls, it's worth noting that the Taylor comes with a standard Progrip, which is a dimple grip. This type of grip is considered one of the best in the market, and works by allowing your fingertips to sit comfortably in the dimples. However, the Taylor International doesn't offer an embedded grip option, which can be a disadvantage for bowlers who struggle with grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Aero Sonic offers a wider range of grips at no extra cost, including a dimple, embedded and non-gripped option. This puts the Aero Sonic ahead in terms of grip options, especially for those who prefer the benefits of an embedded grip, which sits deeper into the bowl and makes it feel smaller in the hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, while the Taylor International offers a high-quality dimple grip, the Aero Sonic provides a greater variety of grips to suit different preferences and needs. Ultimately, the choice between the two models will largely depend on the individual bowler's grip requirements and personal preferences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Taylor International and the Aero Sonic lawn bowls are relatively similar. The Taylor International can be found for around £360 new and for £100-£190 second hand, while the Aero Sonic is priced at around £400 new and £300-£360 second hand if you can find them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That said, it's worth noting that the Taylor International may be a slightly more affordable option if you're in the market for second hand lawn bowls. On the other hand, if you're set on purchasing new and want the option with more advanced technology, the Aero Sonic may be the way to go despite being slightly pricier. Ultimately, the choice between these two popular lawn bowl models will come down to personal preference and factors beyond just price.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor International and the Aero Sonic lawn bowls are popular choices for outdoor play, but they are best suited for different types of players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International's mid-biased design makes it a versatile option that can be used on all surfaces, including outdoor greens. It's ideal for players who enjoy a consistent and reliable bowl that performs well in various weather conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Aero Sonic is a top choice for those who prefer playing exclusively outdoors. Its unique design makes it well-suited for outdoor play, and it's particularly useful when playing in a team as it can be used in multiple positions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two models will depend on individual preferences and playing styles. Those who enjoy playing on a variety of surfaces may find the Taylor International to be a great fit, while those who primarily enjoy outdoor play may find the Aero Sonic to be the better choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the Taylor International and the Aero Sonic lawn bowls, both models have their advantages and are suitable for outdoor play on a variety of surfaces. However, the Aero Sonic is more widely biased and suited for skips, while the Taylor International is more versatile and can be found second hand online. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and play style when choosing between these popular lawn bowl models.</p>
