<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a narrow bias lawn bowl that is perfect for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. This model is ideal for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on the fastest outdoor greens. It is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only in the UK market. However, it can still be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride Professional is a highly versatile lawn bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It has a mid-bias, making it ideal for a variety of playing surfaces and conditions. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, this popular bowl can be found on second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparing the bias of The Drakes Pride Professional and the Taylor Vector VS lawn bowls, it is clear that the Vector VS has a narrower bias compared to the mid-bias of the Professional. The Vector VS is better suited to fast outdoor and indoor rinks and is ideal for lead outdoor bowlers and indoor bowlers. On the other hand, the Professional has a wider bias and is suitable for both indoor and outdoor rinks.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, choosing between these two lawn bowls would depend on the player's specific needs and the rink's conditions. Should the rink be a fast indoor one, the Taylor Vector VS would be suitable, while the Drakes Pride Professional would be more versatile for both indoor and outdoor rinks. Ultimately, both these bowls are excellent choices that offer reliable and consistent bias, providing players with the accuracy and control they need to succeed on the green.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparing the grips of the two models, it is important to note that the Taylor Vector VS comes with the Taylor Progrip, which is a popular dimple grip among bowlers. This grip is known to be one of the best around, but there is no option for an embedded grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride Professional only comes with their standard dimple grip. While this grip is also popular among bowlers, it does not offer the option of an embedded grip, which can be beneficial for individuals who struggle with gripping the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both models offer solid grip options, but it ultimately comes down to personal preference and comfort. The Taylor Vector VS may be more suitable for those who prefer a classic dimple grip, while the Drakes Pride Professional may be a better fit for those who need the added benefit of an embedded grip.</p>

<p>While the difference in price may be a factor when choosing between these two models, it is important to consider other factors such as performance, durability and quality. Both models have their own unique features that make them a popular choice among lawn bowlers.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are an indoor bowler who predominantly plays lead, then the Taylor Vector VS would be a great choice as it is specifically designed for this.
