<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The yard-on shot is one of the productive shots to play in lawn bowls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good yard-on shot can build a lead, or overturn a loss, whilst still have the benefit of working for you even if you miss the mark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is also one of the trickiest to learn and master. I hope this guide will give you a good overview of what it is, how it’s played, and how to practice to improve.</p>

<h2><a href="#what-is-a-yard-on-shot"></a>What is a “yard on” shot?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The yard-on is a weighted shot designed to disrupt either the bowls in the head or the jack. As the name suggests it is played at a similar weight to a draw, but with “a yeard extra pace”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The weight is designed to be enough to disturb the head, whilst also aiming to rest the bowl in the head once it makes contact with another bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The difficulty in the shot is found in the selected weight. With a full drive (where you bowl as fast as you can) you can aim directly at your target as the bowl won’t slow down enough to turn. However, as the “yard-on” is similar to a draw, the bowl will not travel fast enough to prevent it from turning. Therefore you need to account for some minimal turn when selecting your line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Often bowlers will have trouble with this shot because of difficulties selecting the line and will deliver too narrow. The shot will then miss the intended target.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><a href="#why-play-a-yard-on-shot"></a>Why play a “yard-on” shot</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s used to either add shots or cut down a loss. The ideal outcome is to either remove an opponents bowl to improve a count, or to “rest out” the shot bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The “yard-on” can be safer than a full drive as if you miss you can still get a good back position in the head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><a href="#risks-of-playing-the-yard-on-shot"></a>Risks of playing the “yard on” shot</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simply put, it’s much harder to play than a full-drive. A full-on drive will be delivered so fast that the bowl won’t have time to slow down and bend. It’s possible with a full-on drive is to aim directly at your target.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A yard-on shot will still slow and bend, but because of the extra weight, you will not be able to use your existing aiming points. Some adjustments will be required. A yad-on shot is usually a one-off, so you will rarely get a chance to adjust with a second attempt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, as you are aiming to go through the head, you can make contact with your own bowls, and put yourself in a worse position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the full-drive you can play it with a “hit and hope” mindset (there is an element of luck in that sense), whereas with the “yard-on” you can make minor adjustments to the head, but can have major consequences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href="#how-to-play-the-yard-on-shot"></a>How to play the “yard-on” shot</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As with any shot in bowls, it comes down to line, and weight. You need to select the correct line, to account for the bias, and with the correct “yard-on” weight. Not enough weight and you could end up short of the head (i.e., not make it to the target) and look rather silly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#aiming-points-and-line-control"></a>Aiming points and line control</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hardest part of the yard-on is selecting the aiming point. A slightly narrower line from your usual draw will be required as the bowl will hold its line a bit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Great line control will be required to play this shot. If you do have trouble with line control, see our guide here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ideally, you will choose to play the shot on the straighter hand based on how the green has been playing. This side will require less of an adjustment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most bowlers will be too scared of missing on the wide side, but end up very narrow. Unless you are using a “swingy” model of bowl, there should only be a slight adjustment needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a benefit to “getting to know” your <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/finding-the-line-in-lawn-bowls/">bowls in order to find the correct line</a>. Some models start to turn much earlier than others. The earlier they turn the less of an adjustment is needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3><a href="#weight-control"></a>Weight control</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You are not aiming to smash the head to pieces! As the name suggests you need to be able to play a slightly heavier weight than your draw shot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having good weight control is beneficial here. You can check out our guide to weight control here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ideal weight is as if you are bowling to a “back position” on the head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><a href="#drills"></a>Drills</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve split this into two sections. The first is getting the fundamentals of your weight and line right - as this will affect the aiming points used in the second set of drills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#weight-adjustment"></a>Weight adjustment</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><a href="#adding-weight-drill"></a>Adding weight drill</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a favourite of mine - and is covered in our guide to weight control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The drill is simple:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>bowl a single shot at a comfortable weight.</li><li>each subsequent shot should be a yard further on than the last</li><li>The additional weight should not affect the line of the bowl, so if you miss your line, this counts as a “fail”</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will improve your ability to add the right amount of weight, whilst maintaining your form and technique.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#targets"></a>Targets</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This drill is similar to the target practice used in my line control guide, but with a slight twist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The drill is as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Add 4 markers on the green.</li><li>Each one will be a line to aim for.</li><li>Attempt to deliver a bowl over each marker with one shot each.</li><li>Only take one attempt on each target to simulate the single attempt nature of this shot.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="#situational-drills"></a>Situational drills</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m a big fan of situational drills. Too often bowlers practice to bare jacks, but how often do you get this in a real game? If you play skip and need to play these sorts of shots regularly the answer is “never”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firstly, you need to set up real-life scenarios.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><a href="#resting-takeout"></a>Resting Takeout</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The easiest way to do this is if you missed a “yard-on” shot in a game the week before, try and recreate the head. You will need a spare set of bowls to do this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even if it’s not the full thing, just the core 3 or 4 bowls will do. If you can’t think of one try creating a target of 3 bowls in a row. This will give you a large target to practice with. As you get better reduce this to 2 bowls, and then finally reduce to 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The aim of this drill is to hit the target, but a core skill you will learn is to work out how your bowls react to extra weight. When do they start turning? How much weight do I need to keep them running straight?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually, with these target practices, you will be able to instinctively know how much to adjust your line to play your “yard-on” shots.</p>
