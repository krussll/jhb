<p>In this blog post, I'll be comparing two popular lawn bowls - the Henselite Tiger II and the Drakes Pride D-TEC. Together, we'll dive into the specs, bias, grip options, price, and best use for each bowl. You'll walk away with a clearer understanding of which bowl is the perfect fit for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2728} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II is a narrow biased bowl designed for indoor and fast outdoor play. Suitable for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens, it is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market. However, it may be difficult to find second-hand sets online, so purchasing a new set may be necessary.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC is a narrow biased bowl specifically designed for indoor play. It performs best on fast outdoor greens, making it the perfect choice for lead players. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, it may be difficult to find on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay, so purchasing them new is often the best option. Overall, the Drakes Pride D-TEC is a great choice for indoor bowlers looking for precision on the green.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Drakes Pride D-TEC and Henselite Tiger II lawn bowls are narrow biased and designed for use on indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2831} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II is positioned between the Tiger TX and Tiger Pro in their range, while the Drakes Pride D-TEC is the narrowest biased option in their lineup. Both are suitable for indoor bowlers and lead outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Drakes Pride D-TEC should be avoided if primarily playing outdoors in the UK, whereas there is no mention of this restriction for the Henselite Tiger II. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2805} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both bowls are considered appropriate for certain conditions and player abilities, and the choice between the two may ultimately come down to personal preference and specific needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger II features an embedded grip, which is set deeper into the bowl. This can make the bowl feel smaller in the bowler's hand, making it an ideal option for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. In contrast, the Drakes Pride D-TEC comes with a standard dimple grip, which offers small divots along the shoulder of the bowl. This type of grip is a classic style and allows the bowler's fingertips to sit in the dimples, providing a more secure grip.</p>

<p>Ultimately, both the Henselite Tiger II and Drakes Pride D-TEC offer different styles of grip, catering to different bowlers' needs. The embedded grip of the Henselite Tiger II is ideal for those with grip issues, while the classic dimple grip of the Drakes Pride D-TEC provides a secure grip for many bowlers. The choice between the two will depend on the individual's preference and their specific requirements on the green.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Drakes Pride D-TEC is the more budget-friendly option with a new set costing around £290, almost £130 cheaper than the new Henselite Tiger II at around £420. However, the Tiger II holds its value better on the second-hand market, with prices ranging from £200 to £290 compared to the D-TEC's £120 to £200. In terms of overall cost, it may be worth considering how much value you place on a newer model versus a significant discount on a second-hand set. Ultimately, both brands offer high-quality lawn bowls at varying price points, allowing bowlers to select the best option for their budget and needs.</p>
