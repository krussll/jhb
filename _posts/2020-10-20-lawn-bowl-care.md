<h2><a href="#how-to-clean-lawn-bowls"></a>How to clean lawn bowls</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cleaning lawn bowls regularly helps keep them performing well. Over time dirt, grime and grip applications can make your lawn bowls difficult to grip. We recommend washing your lawn bowls every 3 months.</p>

<p>To clean your lawn bowls</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Soak the bowls in hot soapy water</li><li>Use a toothpick to clean out the grooves and grips</li><li>Wash again in clean water to remove any excess debris</li><li>Dry with a miro-fibre cloth</li><li>Give your bowls a final polish with a dedicated bowl polish, or with a polishing sleeve</li></ul>

<h2><a href="#how-to-remove-scuffs"></a>How to remove scuffs</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scuffs and scratches can be frustrating, however, they won’t affect the performance of the bowl. They can occur in many ways during normal play - such as bowls knocking into each other, or my hitting wooden planks in the ditches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If scuffs are annoying you then try one of the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Firstly, try giving the bowl a polish with a dedicated lawn bowl polish. This can sometimes be enough to remove minor marks</li><li>If it’s still there try using a ball of fine steel wool. Gently rub the wool over the mark. Don’t be concerned about damaging the bowl further, the fine steel wool shouldn’t cause any further scratches. After a short period of time wash the bowls and give them a final polish</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are specialist companies who can remove scuffs, however, this is unlikely to be worth the cost as bowls will always get marks!</p>

<h2><a href="#why-polish-lawn-bowls"></a>Why polish lawn bowls?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many reasons why you should regularly polish your lawn bowls. The main reason is it protects the surface of the bowl itself. Much like a protective layer, bowls polish can protect from future scratches and scuffs, whilst also removing minor scratches and marks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowls polish is often used as a grip enhancer. Bowl polishes leave a tacky feel to the bowl, which is ideal for most bowlers, and allows them to control the bowl during their deliver technique.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only reason to avoid polishing your bowls is if you play indoor bowls and a club in your area specifically prohibits it’s use. Many indoor bowls clubs dislike bowls polish as it can leave traces on the carpet which can have a detrimental effect on its longevity.</p>

<h2><a href="#can-you-use-furniture-polish-on-lawn-bowls"></a>Can you use furniture polish on lawn bowls?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whilst using furniture polish won’t damage your lawn bowls, it won’t produce the same results as using a dedicated lawn bowls polish.</p>

<h2><a href="#what-paint-can-i-use-on-lawn-bowls"></a>What paint can I use on lawn bowls?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A quality enamel paint can be used on lawn bowls. The paint is only used during the production process on the grips, rings, and the emblems. The rest of the bowl is coloured through the compound used to create the body of bowl itself. Therefore, it is not recommended to paint the surface of a <a href="https://www.jackhighbowls.com/help/how-lawn-bowls-are-made/">lawn bowl</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="#can-i-repaint-my-lawn-bowls"></a>Can I repaint my lawn bowls?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is possible for lawn bowls to be repainted, however, we would not recommend doing this yourself. The laws around bowl alterations are not clear cut, and you may find yourself turned away by stricter clubs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The issue remains around whether the painting is done to a standard where the bowls remain an “identical set”, and whether the paint alters the bias in some way. This can apply to any painting alterations - whether its a full repaint of the whole bowl, or just the grips or rings</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are lawn bowl renovation companies who are licenced to make these alterations if you do want to spruce up your old set of bowls, and we would recommend finding one in your area if you wish to do this.</p>

<h2><a href="#getting-your-lawn-bowls-stamped"></a>Getting your lawn bowls stamped</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It may not always be necessary to get your lawn bowls stamped, especially if you are playing at club level. However, the stamping process does ensure your bowls are in good condition, and it ensures that the entire set is standard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stamping process will check for any marks or wear that will affect the performance of each bowl. After the process you can be confident that all four bowls will behave correctly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can learn more about the stamping process, and it’s benefits below.</p>

<h2><a href="#how-to-store-lawn-bowls"></a>How to store lawn bowls</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawn bowls are best stored in a bowls bag. This is a small carrier that has four pockets - one for each bowl. This prevents the bowls from getting damaged, as they would otherwise bash together</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you’re not playing, or during the offseason, it is best to store your lawn bowls in a cool dry place. Avoid any environment that is humid or one where the temperature fluctuates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A cupboard under the stairs, or a garage will be ideal. Avoid places such as the attic, or the garden shed.</p>
