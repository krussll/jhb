<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2679} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC is a narrow bias lawn bowl designed for indoor play. It is best suited for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. It may be difficult to find the D-TEC on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay, so purchasing them new may be the better option.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 is a mid-biased lawn bowl that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. It is a versatile bowl that can be used on a variety of surfaces and conditions. The bowl is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only and can be found on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowl is a narrow biased bowl, making it suitable for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowl is a mid-biased bowl, suitable for both indoor and outdoor greens. The key difference between the two is the depth of their grips, with the PRO-50 having a deeper grip than the D-TEC. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the D-TEC is ideal for indoor bowlers, it may not be as suitable for those who predominantly play outdoor bowls in the UK. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both bowls have their unique bias and are suitable for different types of greens and playing styles.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the grips of the Drakes Pride D-TEC and the Drakes Pride PRO-50, it is important to note that they differ in their design. The D-TEC only comes with a standard dimple grip, whereas the PRO-50 offers an embedded grip option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in the hand. This is beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. On the other hand, a dimple grip is a classic style of grip with small divots along the shoulder of the bowl. The idea is that these dimples will provide better grip for the fingertips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two grips will depend on the preferences and needs of individual bowlers. While the embedded grip of the PRO-50 may be helpful for some, others may prefer the classic dimple grip of the D-TEC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Drakes Pride D-TEC and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowls, there is only a marginal difference. The D-TEC can be purchased new for around £290, while the PRO-50 costs around £300. However, the prices for second-hand bowls vary more significantly. The D-TEC can be bought for £120-200, while the PRO-50 can be purchased for £190-260.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the small difference in price for new bowls, the second-hand market for both models offers a more significant saving for those on a budget. However, it's essential to note that the condition of used bowls can vary greatly, and it's crucial to inspect them thoroughly before purchasing. Ultimately, both the D-TEC and PRO-50 offer comparable pricing options, making them accessible to bowlers of all budgets.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride D-TEC lawn bowl is ideal for players who primarily play indoor bowls and who often play as a lead. It has a narrow bias which allows for precision shots and controlled movements on indoor surfaces. However, it can also be played on faster outdoor surfaces. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 lawn bowl is suitable for both indoor and outdoor surfaces. It has a mid-bias which makes it more versatile for various playing conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Drakes Pride D-TEC is best suited for indoor bowlers who want a bowl that can make precise shots and movements. Meanwhile, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 is suitable for players who play on both indoor and outdoor surfaces and want a bowl that is more versatile for different playing conditions. It ultimately comes down to personal preference and playing style for which bowl is the best fit.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Drakes Pride D-TEC and Drakes Pride PRO-50 are high-quality lawn bowls designed for different purposes. While the D-TEC is tailored for indoor play and has a narrow bias, the PRO-50 can be used both indoors and outdoors due to its mid-bias and versatility. The D-TEC may be more difficult to find second hand, but both bowls are available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market.
