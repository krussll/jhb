<p>In this blog post, I'll be comparing two of the most popular models - the Taylor Vector VS and the Taylor Ace. We'll go over everything from specs to grip options, to price and who each bowl is best suited for. By the end of this guide, you'll have a much clearer idea of which lawn bowl will be perfect for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a narrow biased lawn bowl model suitable for indoor and fast outdoor play. It works best for players who specialize in indoor bowling or lead players in fast outdoor greens. Available in sizes 00 to 5, this model is only sold in the UK market, but can be also found in online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Ace is a mid-biased lawn bowl that is perfect for both indoor and outdoor play. It boasts of its versatility, making it a suitable option for a diverse range of surfaces and conditions. It is only available in sizes 00 to 5 within the UK market, and can also be found on second-hand online marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of the Taylor Ace and the Taylor Vector VS lawn bowls is that the Vector VS has a more narrow bias, making it better suited for fast indoor and outdoor greens. The Ace, on the other hand, is a mid-biased bowl that is versatile enough to be used on both indoor rinks and outdoor greens. The Ace is also slightly more biased than the Vector VS, falling between the Blaze and the International in the Taylor range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the choice of bias between the two bowls will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the bowler. If they require a bowl with a more narrow bias for fast greens, the Vector VS would be the better option. However, if they prefer a more versatile bowl that can perform well in both indoor and outdoor settings, the Ace may be the way to go.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparing the grips of the Taylor Ace and the Taylor Vector VS lawn bowls, it's clear that both models have their own unique features. The Taylor Ace offers a choice between two grips: the Progrip, a traditional dimple grip, or the Xtreme grip, an embedded grip. This flexibility allows for bowlers to choose the grip that suits their personal preference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, the Taylor Vector VS only comes with the Progrip as standard and does not offer an embedded grip option. While the Progrip is known for being one of the best dimple grips available, some bowlers may prefer the deeper feel of an embedded grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Taylor Ace and the Taylor Vector VS will depend on a bowler's individual preferences and needs. Those who value versatility may gravitate towards the Taylor Ace, while those who prioritize a top-notch dimple grip may prefer the Taylor Vector VS.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, the Taylor Ace and the Taylor Vector VS are on par with each other. Both models can be purchased new for £360, which is a significant investment for anyone looking to purchase a high-quality set of lawn bowls. However, where the difference lies is in the second-hand market. The Taylor Vector VS can be purchased for a much lower price of £160-£190, while the Taylor Ace can be bought for £160-£230.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This means that if you're looking to save money and are willing to buy second-hand, the Taylor Vector VS may be the better option for you. However, it's important to note that the quality of second-hand bowls can vary, so it's important to inspect them thoroughly before making a purchase. On the other hand, if you're looking to purchase new, then both models will cost you the same amount. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preferences in terms of design and feel, as well as factors like grip and bias, which can vary between the two models.</p>

<p>The Taylor Vector VS and the Taylor Ace are both popular models of lawn bowls, but they have different features that make them suitable for different types of bowlers and playing conditions. The Taylor Vector VS is a narrow biased bowl, designed for indoor bowlers and can also be played on faster outdoor surfaces. It is ideal for bowlers who play lead a lot, as it offers greater control and accuracy over short distances.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Taylor Ace is a mid-biased bowl that can be used on both indoor and outdoor surfaces. It is more versatile than the Taylor Vector VS, making it suitable for bowlers who play in a range of different environments. The Taylor Ace is also great for bowlers who play mid to skip positions, as it offers a good balance between control and strength.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Taylor Vector VS and the Taylor Ace will depend on the bowler's individual needs and preferences. If you're an indoor bowler who plays lead positions, the Taylor Vector VS may be the best option for you.

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor Ace and the Taylor Vector VS are excellent lawn bowls, each with their own unique characteristics and strengths. While the Taylor Vector VS is best suited for indoor play and fast outdoor greens, the Taylor Ace is more versatile and can be used on a wider range of surfaces and conditions.
