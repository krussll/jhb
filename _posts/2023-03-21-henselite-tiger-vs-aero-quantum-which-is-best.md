<p>We'll be comparing two popular models of lawn bowls - the Henselite Tiger and the Aero Quantum. Throughout this guide, we'll look at the specs of the bowls, their bias, grip options, price, and who they'll be best suited for. By the end of this post, you'll know exactly which bowl fits your needs the best!</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2719} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger is a wide biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play. It boasts versatility on all outdoor surfaces and is particularly suited for skip players. Sold in the UK market only, the Henselite Tiger is available in sizes 00 to 5. However, finding them secondhand online can prove difficult, so purchasing new may be necessary.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum is a narrow biased lawn bowl that is perfect for indoor play and fast outdoor greens. It is best suited for those who play lead and is available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only. Although it may be hard to find on online second-hand marketplaces, it is still worth considering purchasing the Aero Quantum new.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger and Aero Quantum lawn bowls have differing biases that make them suitable for different play conditions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2828} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tiger has a wide bias, making it a great choice for outdoor greens and surfaces. It is not recommended for indoor play, however. The Aero Quantum, on the other hand, has a narrow bias and is better suited for indoor rinks, but can also be used on outdoor greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to choosing between the two, it really depends on the player's preferred play style and the conditions they will be playing in. If playing mainly outdoors, the Henselite Tiger may be the way to go. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2826} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whereas if playing predominantly indoors, the Aero Quantum would be the better choice. Overall, it is important to consider the specific bias of each bowl and how it will perform in the given conditions to select the bowl that best suits your needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aero Quantum offers the most diverse range of grip options, including a dimple, embedded, and non-gripped option, all at no additional cost. In contrast, the Henselite Tiger comes with its own embedded grip, called the Henselite Mega grip, as standard. The Henselite Mega grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand and aiding those with grip issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero Quantum's dimple grip, on the other hand, sports small divots running along the shoulder of the bowl, allowing your fingertips to sit in them and providing a better grip. It's important to note that all of Aero's grip options are available across a wide range of their products, including the Aero GrooVe and Aero Sonic, while other brands may not offer their full range of grip choices across their product lines. Ultimately, the choice between the two models will come down to personal preference and which grip option suits the bowler's needs best.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger and Aero Quantum are priced similarly, with both costing around £400 when bought new. However, if you're looking to buy a used set, the price range differs slightly. The Tiger II can be found second hand for around £200-£690, while a set of second-hand Aero Quantum's usually range from £300-£360.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both lawn bowls are priced competitively and offer players a range of features that suit their needs. The decision ultimately comes down to personal preference in terms of feel, weight, and grip. It's important to try out both models and make an informed decision based on your individual playing style and budget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are an outdoor lawn bowler seeking a wide biased bowl, the Henselite Tiger would be an ideal choice for you. It provides excellent results on outdoor greens but isn't recommended for indoor usage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, if you're looking for a bowl that can be used for both indoor and outdoor play, the Aero Quantum may be the one for you. This narrow biased bowl is versatile and can be used in various positions on an indoor team. Outdoors, it's perfect for lead bowlers seeking accuracy and control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two models depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you play primarily outdoors and prefer a wide biased bowl, go for the Henselite Tiger. But if you want one bowl that can perform well in any setting, the Aero Quantum is the way to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After comparing the Henselite Tiger and the Aero Quantum lawn bowls, it is clear that both models have their own unique strengths. The Henselite Tiger is ideal for outdoor play and suited to skips, while the Aero Quantum is best for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. Both bowls are only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and are hard to find on second-hand marketplaces like eBay. Ultimately, the choice between the Henselite Tiger and the Aero Quantum will depend on the individual player's preferences and the type of greens they typically play on.</p>
