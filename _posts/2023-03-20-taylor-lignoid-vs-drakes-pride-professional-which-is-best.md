<p>Together, we will look at the specifications, bias, grip options, and prices of both bowls to help you decide which one is the perfect fit for you. By the end of this guide, you'll be equipped with the knowledge you need to confidently make your decision.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid is a wide biased bowl designed for outdoor play and is particularly suited to skips. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, it is ideal for use on all outdoor surfaces. Despite being an older model, the Taylor Lignoid is still popular and can be easily found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowl is a mid-biased, versatile option suitable for both indoor and outdoor play on various surfaces and conditions. It comes in sizes 00-5 for the UK market only and can sometimes be found on second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lignoid and Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowls have different biases that make them suitable for different playing conditions. The Lignoid is a wide biased bowl, making it ideal for outdoor greens. It is the widest bowl in the Taylor range and should be avoided if you predominantly play indoors. On the other hand, the Professional is a mid-biased bowl that can be used for both indoor rinks and outdoor greens. It is between the D-TEC and the XP in the Drakes Pride range, making it suitable for bowlers of varying levels.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the bias of the Lignoid and the Professional provides different advantages depending on the playing conditions. If you play predominantly outdoors, the Lignoid's wide bias will give you a larger target to aim at. However, it may be less effective indoors where a mid-biased bowl like the Professional may be more suitable. Ultimately, the choice between these two bowls will depend on personal preference and the type of surface you will be playing on.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the grips of the Taylor Lignoid and the Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowls, it's important to note that the former comes with the Taylor Progrip as standard. This gripping system is a dimple grip and is highly regarded as one of the best around. On the other hand, the Professional only comes with a standard dimple grip from Drakes Pride. While this is a classic style of grip and features small divots that help to improve your grip, it doesn't offer the same level of customization as the Taylor Progrip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One area where the two models differ is in the option of an embedded grip. The Taylor Lignoid doesn't come with this option, while an embedded grip is the only choice for the Drakes Pride Professional. An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, which makes it feel smaller in your hand. This can be helpful for bowlers who struggle with gripping the bowl properly. Ultimately, both the Taylor Lignoid and the Drakes Pride Professional have their unique features when it comes to the grip of their lawn bowls.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the price of two popular models of lawn bowls, the Taylor Lignoid and the Drakes Pride Professional, it is important to note that both of these models can be bought new for around £290. However, there is quite a price range when it comes to purchasing these bowls second hand. The Taylor Lignoid can be found for around £90-130, while the Drakes Pride Professional can be found for around £60-210.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems that the price range for the Taylor Lignoid is a bit more steady, with a smaller gap between the new and second hand prices. On the other hand, the price range for the Drakes Pride Professional is quite varied, with a significant difference between the cheapest and most expensive second hand options. It is worth noting that while both models can be quite pricey, investing in a high-quality lawn bowl can make all the difference when it comes to the game.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are someone who primarily plays lawn bowls outdoors and needs a bowl with a wide bias, then the Taylor Lignoid would be the ideal choice for you. It is designed to work exceptionally well on outdoor surfaces and provides an incredible level of accuracy, control and stability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, if you are someone who plays both indoors and outdoors and need a more versatile option, then the Drakes Pride Professional would be the best choice. It is a mid-biased bowl that can handle a wide range of surface variations and still offer an excellent level of control and accuracy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Taylor Lignoid and the Drakes Pride Professional will depend on what type of surfaces you typically play on and whether you need a bowl that is more specialized or versatile. Both models deliver superb performance and are popular among lawn bowls players worldwide, so you can't go wrong with either option.</p>

<p>Overall, both the Taylor Lignoid and Drakes Pride Professional lawn bowls are excellent choices for players of all skill levels. The Taylor Lignoid is a great option for those who want a bowl specifically designed for outdoor play and suited to skips.
