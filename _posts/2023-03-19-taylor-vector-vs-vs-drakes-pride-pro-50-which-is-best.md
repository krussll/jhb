<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a narrow biased lawn bowl that is perfect for indoor play and fast outdoor games. It is highly recommended for indoor bowlers or those who play lead on fast outdoor greens. This model is only available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, but can easily be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay. With its unique design and high-quality construction, the Taylor Vector VS is an excellent choice for serious lawn bowlers who demand the best.</p>

<p>The Drakes Pride PRO-50 is a mid-biased lawn bowl that is highly versatile and suitable for both indoor and outdoor play on a range of surfaces and conditions. It is available in sizes 00 to 5, but only for the UK market. If you're in the market for this model, you may be able to find it on second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of The Drakes Pride PRO-50 and the Taylor Vector VS lawn bowls is the degree of bias. The Vector VS has a narrow bias, making it ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. It is best suited for indoor bowlers and lead outdoor bowlers. On the other hand, the PRO-50 has a mid-bias, making it suitable for both indoor rinks and outdoor greens. It is ideal for both indoor bowlers and outdoor bowlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another difference is the range they belong to. The Vector VS is between the Lazer and the Blaze in the Taylor range, while the PRO-50 is between the D-TEC and the XP in the Drakes Pride range. Additionally, the PRO-50 has a deeper grip than the popular Professional bowl, which makes it easier for bowlers to handle it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Drakes Pride PRO-50 and the Taylor Vector VS lawn bowls have distinct biases and features that make them suitable for different playing conditions and skill levels. Bowlers should choose the lawn bowl that best suits their needs and preferences for optimal performance.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both the Taylor Vector VS and the Drakes Pride PRO-50 have excellent grip options. The Taylor Vector VS comes with the standard Taylor Progrip which is a high-quality dimple grip. However, it does not offer an embedded grip option. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 does offer an embedded grip which is set deeper into the bowl and is great for bowlers who struggle with grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To choose between the two models based on grip, it ultimately depends on personal preference and specific needs. If you are comfortable with a classic dimple grip and don't have concerns with gripping the bowl properly, then the Taylor Vector VS with the Progrip is an excellent choice. However, if you are someone who struggles with grip, then the Drakes Pride PRO-50 with the embedded grip might be the better option for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price comparison of lawn bowls, the Taylor Vector VS and Drakes Pride PRO-50 both fall within a similar range, with a slight difference in their cost. The Taylor Vector VS is slightly higher priced, with a new set costing around £360, while a second-hand set can be purchased for around £160-£190. On the other hand, the Drakes Pride PRO-50 is relatively cheaper, with a new set costing around £300, and a second-hand set priced at around £190-£260.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it's essential to keep in mind that the cost of lawn bowls should not be the sole factor when making a purchase. The material, design, size, and weight of the bowl should also be considered before making a final decision. Additionally, it is important to note that investing in high-quality lawn bowls, such as the Taylor Vector VS and Drakes Pride PRO-50, can pay off in the long run by providing better performance, durability, and precision on the greens. Ultimately, the decision between the two models will depend on the individual's preferences and needs.</p>
