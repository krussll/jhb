<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throughout this guide, I'll assess the spec of the bowls, their bias, grip options, cost, and audience fit. By the end, you'll have a crystal-clear picture of which option is the perfect match for you.</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2706} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor International is a versatile and mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl, designed for outdoor use on a range of conditions and surfaces. It is available in UK sizes 00 to 5 and can be found on second-hand marketplaces like eBay.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Legacy SL is a wide-biased lawn bowl designed for outdoor play, making it perfect for a variety of surfaces. This model is particularly suited to the role of skips and is available in sizes ranging from 00 to 5 for the UK market. Those looking to pick up a Taylor Legacy SL on a budget may be interested in searching for second-hand options on marketplaces such as eBay.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Legacy SL and the Taylor International lawn bowls are ideal for outdoor greens and suitable for all outdoor surfaces. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2824} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, there is a distinct difference in their bias. The International is a midbiased or wide biased bowl, positioned between the Ace and the Legacy in the Taylor range. In contrast, the Legacy SL is a wide biased bowl, positioned between the International and the Lignoid in the Taylor range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, while the International is suitable for all outdoor surfaces, the Legacy SL should be avoided if you play predominantly indoors. The key takeaway is that the International is a more versatile bowl with a moderate level of bias, while the Legacy SL is more specialized for outdoor greens with a stronger bias. </p>

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2811} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the two depends on the player's preference and the specific conditions of the playing surface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor International and Taylor Legacy SL lawn bowls come with standard Taylor Progrip, which is a dimple grip that provides good traction. However, neither of these models offer an embedded grip option which is considered better than a dimple grip. An embedded grip is deeper and makes the bowl feel smaller, which is beneficial for bowlers who struggle with gripping.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, both bowls' grips are reliable and efficient but lack an embedded grip, which can provide even greater control and stability. Ultimately, the choice between these two models may come down to other factors such as weight or bias, and personal preference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to price, there is a notable difference between the Taylor Legacy SL and the Taylor International lawn bowls. The Taylor Legacy SL is the more affordable option, with a new set costing £290 compared to the £360 price tag for the Taylor International.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it is worth noting that both models can be purchased second hand at a lower price point, the difference in price between the two remains consistent. The Taylor Legacy SL can be found for around £100-£160 second hand, while the Taylor International sits at around £100-£190.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between these two popular models of lawn bowls may come down to personal preference and budget. Those looking for a more affordable option may lean towards the Taylor Legacy SL, while those willing to make a larger investment may opt for the Taylor International.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When considering the Taylor International and the Taylor Legacy SL, it is important to consider the type of surface you will be playing on. The Taylor International is a mid-biased bowl that can be played on all surfaces, making it a versatile option for those who play both indoors and outdoors. However, it is designed with outdoor play in mind and may be better suited for those who primarily play on grass surfaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the Taylor Legacy SL is a wide biased bowl that is specifically designed for outdoor play. It should be avoided if you play indoors, as its wide bias can cause it to be unpredictable and difficult to control on indoor surfaces. The Taylor Legacy SL is best suited for those who play exclusively on grass surfaces and are looking for a bowl that can offer them greater control and precision in their shot-making.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Taylor International and the Taylor Legacy SL will depend on your personal playing preferences and the type of surface you most frequently play on. Both bowls offer unique benefits and advantages, and it is important to consider these factors when making your decision.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, both the Taylor International and Taylor Legacy SL are popular models of lawn bowls with their own unique features. The Taylor International is a versatile mid-to-wide biased bowl, while the Taylor Legacy SL is a wide biased bowl suited for outdoor play on any surface, particularly for skips. Both bowls are available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and can be found on online second-hand marketplaces like eBay.
