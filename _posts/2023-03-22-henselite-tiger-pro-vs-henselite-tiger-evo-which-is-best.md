<p>In this blog post, I'll be comparing two of the most popular models - the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Henselite Tiger EVO - to help you make the right choice. Together, we'll dive into the specs, bias, grip options, price, and who these bowls are best suited for.

<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2726} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro is a high-end lawn bowl with a mid-bias, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor play. Its versatility and adaptability to various surfaces make it a popular choice among bowlers. Available in sizes 00 to 5 in the UK market, it is often difficult to find second-hand options on online marketplaces. However, with its premium quality and performance, the Henselite Tiger Pro is one of the most expensive models available.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger EVO is a mid-to-wide biased lawn bowl that is perfect for outdoor play. It is a versatile bowl that can be used on various surfaces and conditions. Available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market only, it may be difficult to find secondhand online, so purchasing new is recommended.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2798} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the bias of the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Henselite Tiger EVO is that the latter is wider biased, making it more suitable for outdoor greens. The Tiger Pro, on the other hand, is mid-biased and is suitable for both indoor and outdoor rinks. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both models are designed to suit all types of bowlers, with the Tiger Pro being more versatile for those who play year-round, while the Tiger EVO is great for those who prefer outdoor surfaces. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2838} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the bias of these two models caters to different preferences and playing conditions, allowing bowlers to choose the option that works best for them.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Henselite Tiger EVO lawn bowls come with the same embedded Henselite Mega grip as standard. This type of grip is set deeper into the bowl, making it feel smaller in your hand, which can be beneficial for those who have trouble gripping the bowl properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the classic dimple grip (with small divots along the bowl's shoulder) is not a feature of either of these models. However, the embedded grip provides ample grip and control for bowlers of all levels. Ultimately, the choice between the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Henselite Tiger EVO will come down to other factors such as weight, bias, and personal preferences.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger Pro and Henselite Tiger EVO lawn bowls have a similar price range, with both costing around £400 brand new and around £250-£300 second hand. Therefore, the price is not a distinguishing factor between the two models. Other factors, such as grip, bias, and weight, may be considered to determine which model is best for your individual needs.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro and the Henselite Tiger EVO are two great options for lawn bowls, but they cater to different needs. The Tiger Pro is a dual-purpose bowl and is perfect for those who play both indoors and outdoors. Due to its flexibility, it can be played in multiple positions in a team, making it an ideal choice for those who like to mix things up. On the other hand, the Tiger EVO is a mid-biased bowl that is designed for outdoor play specifically. While it can be used on any surface, it is best suited for outdoor playing due to its bias. If you are an outdoor player, the Tiger EVO would be the better option for you. However, if you are someone who likes to play both indoors and outdoors, then the Tiger Pro would be the ideal choice.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Henselite Tiger EVO are excellent lawn bowls, but they cater to different preferences. If you primarily play indoors or outdoors on a variety of surfaces, the Henselite Tiger Pro would be a great choice for you. However, if you mostly play outdoors and need a bowl that can handle different conditions, the Henselite Tiger EVO is the way to go. Ultimately, both models are high-quality, but it's important to consider your specific needs before making a purchase.</p>
