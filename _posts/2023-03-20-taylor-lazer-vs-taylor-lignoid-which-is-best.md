<p>The Taylor Lignoid lawn bowl is a wide biased option that is perfect for outdoor play. It is suitable for use on all types of outdoor surfaces and is particularly popular among skips.

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Lignoid are two lawn bowls that differ significantly in terms of their bias. While the Lazer is a narrow biased bowl, the Lignoid is a wide biased bowl. The former is the narrowest bowl in the Taylor range and is best suited for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens. In contrast, the Lignoid is between the widest bowl in the Taylor range and is ideal for outdoor greens.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is important to note that these two bowls are designed specifically for different playing conditions. The Lazer is suitable for indoor bowlers and should be avoided if you play predominantly outdoors in the UK. In contrast, the Lignoid is suitable for all outdoor surfaces and should be avoided if you play predominantly indoors. Ultimately, the choice of bowl will depend on the specific playing conditions and the player's individual style and preference.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Lignoid come with the Taylor Progrip as standard, which is a dimple grip that provides good traction for bowlers. However, neither model offers the option of an embedded grip, which is known to improve grip for bowlers with difficulties.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, which makes it feel smaller in your hand and can improve grip. In contrast, a dimple grip is a classic style that features small divots (dimples) along the shoulder of the bowl that help your fingertips grip the surface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, both models are well-suited for bowlers, with the primary difference being the grip style. While the Taylor Lazer and Lignoid both have a standard dimple grip, bowlers who prefer an embedded grip may need to consider other options.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to comparing the price of the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Lignoid lawn bowls, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly, the new price for both models is the same at £290. However, when it comes to secondhand prices, the two models differ significantly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Lazer seems to retain its value better, as the price for a used set ranges from £150-£170. Meanwhile, the Taylor Lignoid can be purchased for a significantly lower price, with a used set costing between £90-£130.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the decision between the two models may come down to personal preference and budget. While the Taylor Lazer may be a more expensive option, it may be worth the investment if it holds its value better in the long run. Meanwhile, the more affordable Taylor Lignoid may be a better option for those who are just starting out with lawn bowling or are on a tighter budget.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are an indoor bowler who plays lead, the Taylor Lazer would be the perfect choice for you. It is a narrow biased bowl, which means that it is designed to travel in a straight line with a gentle curve towards the end. However, if you play outdoors, the Taylor Lazer may not be the ideal choice for you as it is primarily designed for indoor use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, if you are an outdoor bowler, the Taylor Lignoid might be the perfect choice for you. It is a wide biased bowl, which means that it is designed to travel in a curved line towards the jack. The Taylor Lignoid is ideal for those who play solely outdoors as it is specifically designed for outdoor use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the choice between the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Lignoid depends on your individual playing style and whether you prefer indoor or outdoor bowling. No matter which model you choose, both the Taylor Lazer and the Taylor Lignoid are high-quality lawn bowls that are sure to improve your game.</p>
