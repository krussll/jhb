<p>The Henselite Tiger Pro is a high-quality mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for indoor and outdoor play on a variety of surfaces. With sizes ranging from 00 to 5, it caters to the UK market exclusively. While it may be difficult to find the Henselite Tiger Pro on online second-hand marketplaces such as eBay, it is available for purchase new. However, this model comes at a premium price and is one of the most expensive bowls on the market.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both The Henselite Tiger Pro and the Taylor International are mid-biased bowls, meaning they have a moderate amount of bias or curve. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":2798} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Taylor International is considered a mid/wide bias bowl, while the Henselite Tiger Pro sits in between the Tiger and Tiger II models. Additionally, the Taylor International is designed specifically for outdoor greens, while the Tiger Pro is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, bowlers looking for a mid-biased bowl designed for outdoor play may prefer the Taylor International, while those who play both indoors and outdoors may appreciate the versatility of the Henselite Tiger Pro. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to also consider personal preference and experience with different bowls when selecting the right one for your game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In comparing the grips of the Henselite Tiger Pro and the Taylor International lawn bowls, it's important to note that the Taylor International comes with a standard dimple grip called the Taylor Progrip. While the Progrip is considered one of the best dimple grips available, it doesn't offer the option of an embedded grip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the Henselite Tiger Pro comes with the Henselite Mega grip, which is an embedded grip set deeper into the bowl. This grip can be beneficial for bowlers who struggle with grip issues, as the deep set grip can make the bowl feel smaller in their hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, while both these lawn bowls offer high-quality grips, the choice between a classic dimple grip and a deep-set embedded grip will come down to individual preference and the bowler's specific needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the price of the Taylor International and the Henselite Tiger Pro lawn bowls, it's evident that the former is relatively more affordable. You can purchase a new set of Taylor International bowls for £360, while a brand new Henselite Tiger Pro set retails at around £400. Additionally, the cost of the Henselite Tiger Pro second hand is higher than the Taylor International, ranging from £250-£300 as opposed to £100-£190 for the Taylor International.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, if you're looking for a cheaper option without compromising on quality, the Taylor International is a good choice. However, if you want to own high-end, top-quality lawn bowls, the Henselite Tiger Pro is a good investment. In the end, the choice ultimately comes down to personal preference and budget.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>If you are looking for a lawn bowl that is specifically geared towards outdoor play, the Taylor International would be an excellent choice for you.

However, if you are looking for a more versatile option that can be used indoors and outdoors, the Henselite Tiger Pro would be the right choice. Its dual purpose nature makes it perfect for anyone who wants to play in both environments. Additionally, the Tiger Pro's flexibility allows for multiple positions during team play, making it an excellent choice for team players.
