<p>Together, we'll dive into the spec, bias, grip options, price, and ultimately who each bowl will be best suited for. By the end of this guide, you'll be equipped with the knowledge you need to confidently choose the perfect lawn bowl for you. Let's get started.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spec</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Taylor Vector VS is a narrow bias lawn bowl that is best suited for indoor play and fast-paced outdoor greens. It is particularly popular amongst indoor bowlers and those who play as leads on faster outdoor surfaces. It is available in sizes 00 to 5, though it is only available for purchase in the UK. Anyone looking to purchase a Taylor Vector VS can typically find them on second-hand online marketplaces such as eBay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero GrooVe is a versatile mid-biased lawn bowl suitable for both indoor and outdoor play on various surfaces and conditions. It comes in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market and may be difficult to find second hand, warranting a new purchase.</p>

<h2>Bias</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main difference between the Aero GrooVe and Taylor Vector VS lawn bowls is their bias. The Vector VS is a narrow biased bowl, while the GrooVe is a mid-biased bowl. The Vector VS is ideal for indoor rinks and fast outdoor greens, making it suitable for indoor bowlers and lead outdoor bowlers. Meanwhile, the GrooVe is suitable for both indoor and outdoor greens, and suitable for both indoor and outdoor bowlers.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aero GrooVe is between the Quantum and the Sonic in the Aero range, while the Vector VS is between the Lazer and the Blaze in the Taylor range. Ultimately, which lawn bowl to choose will depend on the individual's preference and skill level. Those who prefer a narrower bias and faster greens may prefer the Taylor Vector VS, while those who want a mid-bias bowl for different greens may prefer the Aero GrooVe.</p>

<h2>Grips</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to grip options on lawn bowls, the Aero GrooVe offers more choices than the Taylor Vector VS. Aero offers a dimple, embedded, and non-gripped option, all of which come as standard and cost nothing extra. This is unlike the Taylor Vector VS, which only comes with the Progrip as standard and does not offer an embedded grip option.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Taylor Progrip is considered one of the best dimple grips available, an embedded grip is considered even better for bowlers who have trouble gripping the bowl. This is because an embedded grip is set deeper into the bowl, which can make it feel smaller in your hand and give you a more secure grip. On the other hand, a dimple grip is a classic form of grip where small divots run along the shoulder of the bowl. This allows your fingertips to sit in the dimples and get a better grip.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Aero GrooVe offers more options when it comes to grip choices, while the Taylor Vector VS only provides the Progrip as a standard option. However, both grips have their strengths and can be ideal for different types of bowlers.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When comparing the prices of the Taylor Vector VS and the Aero GrooVe lawn bowls, it is important to note that both models fall in the expensive range of lawn bowls. The Taylor Vector VS comes at a slightly cheaper price point with a new set costing £360, while a second hand set is available for £160-£190. The Aero GrooVe, on the other hand, is priced slightly higher, with a new set selling for around £400. Second hand sets of Aero GrooVe can be found for £300-£360, but they are often hard to come by.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While price is an important factor to consider when buying a lawn bowl, it should not be the only factor. Other factors such as grip, feel, size, and weight all play a crucial role in determining the suitability of a lawn bowl for an individual player. Both the Taylor Vector VS and the Aero GrooVe models have their own strengths and weaknesses, and players should make an informed decision based on their preferences and budget.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are an indoor bowler who mostly plays as a lead, the Taylor Vector VS would be the best fit for you. Its narrow bias is perfect for indoor surfaces, and it will help you get the perfect line to set up your team for success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those who want to play both indoors and outdoors, and who don't necessarily have a set position, the Aero GrooVe is the ideal choice. This dual-purpose bowl has the flexibility to be used in multiple positions in a team, and its design ensures that it can be played on both indoor and outdoor surfaces with ease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the best bowl for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. Both models have their unique advantages, and it's up to you to decide which one suits you best based on your playing style and the type of surfaces you typically play on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Taylor Vector VS and the Aero GrooVe are popular models of lawn bowls, but they differ in their biases and ideal playing conditions. The Taylor Vector VS is narrow-biased and best for indoor or fast outdoor play, while the Aero GrooVe is mid-biased and more versatile for use on a variety of surfaces and conditions. Both bowls are available in sizes 00 to 5 for the UK market, but the Aero GrooVe can be harder to find second-hand. Ultimately, choosing between these two bowls will depend on the individual's playing style and preferred conditions.</p>
